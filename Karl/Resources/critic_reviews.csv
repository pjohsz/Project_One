Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE,"Star Wars is, indeed, a movie that dares to be different, not only in setting, but in theme at a time when imagination has surrendered to realism in motion pictures. If you don't enjoy Star Wars, you are not as young at heart as you think you are."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE,"It's a ""fun movie"", as they say. Meaning that it doesn't mean anything, it's a superior, pop plaything to play with, to be innocently enjoyed and thrown away like a four-dollar comic book."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI,"Lucas has once again recycled the B movies of his youth: jungle movies, gangster movies, pirate movies, you name it. He culls bits from them that still have oomph and mounts them with a Sesame-Street zap."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI,"Though the 1983 film's effects seem almost quaint by today's awesome standards, Jedi has something the newer movies don't: characters we care about, not to mention a plot that involves both them and us."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI,"While much of the action is perfunctory and overdone, director Richard Marquand has managed some thrilling sequences as well, and the family drama centering on Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader lends depth to the colorful proceedings."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI,Jedi is downright repetitive!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI,Let's not pretend we're watching art!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI,Jedi still has its grand moments.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI,"A good piece of cinema. It is far from perfection, and far from the heights reached by its two predecessors, but it still can entertain the audience -- not just the children who would enjoy Ewoks."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"From the point of view of the series as a whole, the new movie is pure backstory. And in spite of all the zipping and zapping, its own plot barely advances an inch."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Exceptional fight choreography coupled with one of the best songs in Star Wars' history certainly isn't enough to save [it], but next time someone makes the ill-advised choice to check it out, you at least have [a] great sequence to look forward to."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"From the ridiculous title, with those two M's gummily stuck together in the middle, to the uniformly atrocious performances, from the incomprehensible plot to the sluggish pacing, The Phantom Menace is an unsalvageable disaster."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is the weakest movie in the series, but that does not mean it's an absolute disaster. "
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"As a standalone film, The Phantom Menace probably won't appeal to kids raised on rapid editing and epic explosions, nor does it work as an introduction to the Star Wars universe."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It is not remotely devoid of value. It's just that none of this value comes from plot, character, or capacity to provide entertainment."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The saga begins with this relentlessly erratic installment...
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Everything in Phantom Menace exists in a bright noisy vacuum.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The movie is fun, for the most part, and several scenes are as good or better than anything Lucas created in the original films. The human characters, however, are not nearly as interesting as those in the earlier episodes."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,What if it had been good? What if it had been a movie?
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"'The Phantom Menace' is definitely the major reason most fans, even prequel apologists like myself, don't watch the Star Wars saga in chronological order."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Do kids really want to follow a plot about intergalactic trade embargoes?
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"If there's anything really disappointing about Episode I, it's not being able to line up for Episode 2 tomorrow."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"In his new work, Lucas often forgets his story to linger on sets. Perhaps more accurately, this is a film about sets and mythologies that come out of the cheesiest sci-fi tradition."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The visual effects in The Phantom Menace are so good that you find yourself not caring very much about Qui-Gon's prophetic murmurings.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"As each magnificently choreographed set piece unfolds in The Phantom Menace, there's little doubt that George Lucas knows how to create populist entertainment at its best."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Forget the overworked plot... Marvel instead at the state-of-the-art technical wizardry and fizzing action that's just enough to keep nostalgic wistfulness at bay.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Neeson and McGregor seem so focused on hitting their marks for the blue screen, that they barely make eye contact, let alone generate any genuine emotion."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,None of the human actors here make much of an impression.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,What I can't comprehend is why the political details had to be so tedious and abstract. Will the kids of our nation and the world truly be titillated by trade wars and the spectacle of a do-nothing Senate?
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Look, I wanted to love The Phantom Menace, too. I was an adolescent boy and would enjoy being one again for a couple of hours. But the movie has a way of deflating all but the most delusional of hopes."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Mr. Lucas is not without a certain technocratic sagacity, but I don't think he's communicating even with the young as astutely as he once did."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Character and personality take a back seat on this ride.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"This is just another 3D cash grab by George Lucas. If you didn't like the film before, you won't like the film now."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The Force may not be strong in this episode, but it's there."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Anyone hoping the 3D would make-up for the film's many shortcomings, will probably continue to feel cheated by the first Star Wars prequel."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,We don't want to remember it's pretty bad. Then we do.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Has a film director ever induced such terrible performances from such great actors? Liam Neeson - wooden, Ewan McGregor - monotone and the Oscar winning Natalie Portman - a speaking alarm clock!"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It hardly needs to be said that the 3D conversion here is nothing more than proficient, that it adds nothing and actually takes away some of the clarity and vividness of the film's varied colour palette."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Darth Maul is back, this time waving his wand in 3D. ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" was poorly received by critics when it debuted, so does it fare any better with its new up-conversion? Not really. Paul Chambers, CNN."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,This is really only for the hardcore fans and kids.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It's a nifty enough film that's entertaining but not comparable to the original 'Star Wars.'
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It's cinematic junk food, the pernicious effect of which had already set in long before this film came out."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The Phantom Menace is, at best and worst, a mediocre film-a boring adventure undermined by anemic political theatrics and the rusty artistic tastes of its maker."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The 3D conversion on this film is one of the best I've ever seen... and that's what makes it worth paying some extra money to see it again in the theater.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"""Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace"" got dismissive reviews in 1999, and it deserves the same today. But you probably know that."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"You realize how much humor Harrison Ford brought to things; without him, at times the movie itself feels frozen in Carbonite."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The Phantom Menace, in any number of dimensions, is an exercise in disappointment, a film filled with enough callbacks to the first trilogy to remind you about what you loved about them without adding much of note in all the new material."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Naturally, if you already despise everything George Lucas touches, well, these aren't the droids you're looking for. It's more of a 3D party for fans and admirers, playing to the convinced with a conversion."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,You may never experience this or any Star Wars movie as a cinematic experience ever again. Especially not in theater.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The 3D conversion isn't going to change your opinion on the movie or give you a whole new moviegoing experience, but it's not bad either."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Oh George, why?"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The special effects are something to see in 3D, but don't listen too closely to the screenplay or try to work out who is who."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"A pop-culture calamity, a soulless, passionless film whose only real effect was to smudge the happy memories of the three originals."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"For the most part, the sludgy re-processing of the original leaves everything looking as if it was lensed through a wet, worn sock. Only one sequence -- the epic pod race on the planet Tatooine -- goes close to making any worthwhile use of the 3D format"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The only plus point is introducing newbies to the big-screen Star Wars experience -- if the 3D price is right for you.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Still unsure of the basic mechanics of the plot, drags in places and that Binks chap wasn't just a bad dream, but when it soars, it soars."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The added visual depth does little to disguise quite how flat everything in between is.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,I will say this: the time and money they spent working on this post-conversion is evident in the final result. It is technically very impressive.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The Phantom Menace's fleeting pleasures aren't even table scraps to my inner child.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The under-utilised 3D adds little to this prequel, which only serves as a sore reminder of the brilliance of the original films."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It's difficult to discern precisely where this all went wrong, and even more difficult to speculate about possible improvements."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Kid-centric but violent prequel lacks energy of originals.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Honestly, I had a decent time."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Is it ironic or just par for the course that the most technologically radical FX film ever made would also be the most egregiously regressive blockbuster imaginable?
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Episode One lacks a lot of the heart the original series embraced
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The special effects are some of the most dazzling and amazing ever seen on the big screen. In addition, the acting is excellent."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Clearly there is something wrong with a film, when the loudest applause occurs as the curtain goes up, in anticipation of, rather than response to, what is being seen."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The visuals are indeed eye-popping, but I was left with no vested emotional tie to either story or characters."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The horror of Jar Jar Binks aside, there's plenty in Episode I to keep us entertained."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It's still a galaxy far, far away, and it still looks like nothing we've ever seen before."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Charmless, sexless, passionless and robot-humoured, it's preposterously uninvolving."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It's good to have Star Wars -- any Star Wars -- back after such a long time; and it's worth seeing.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Despite a shaky start and the presence of questionable elements throughout, by the time it arrives at its finale The Phantom Menace has won its place alongside the original Star Wars trilogy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Lucas has protected his multibillion-dollar franchise by making a film targeted at children. It gives them exactly what they want--eye candy that moves at light speed.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,What's important to remember is that the better moments don't merely balance out the weaker ones - they topple them.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"What is most striking about Lucas' movies -- all his movies, including THX 1138 and American Graffiti -- is a sort of startling obviousness."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,I must take issue with the intense backlash from other critics against the film.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,No film made could measure up to the avalanche of buzz and craziness surrounding this release. There is plenty of both good and bad news here.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,I enjoyed the film and feel that it established the foundation for many story elements that were curiously unexplained in the previous trilogy.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"As an artist, Lucas is lacking, but as a businessman he knows his stuff."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Film franchises come and go all the time in Hollywood, particularly in science-fiction circles, but the Force is still strong in this one."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"There are no romance, no humor, ultimately nobody to care about in this oddly sterile movie."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Lucas' films might not be very deep, but they're very complex and involving in a comic book kind of way."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Even with a pretty rotten crust the toppings are still delicious.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The movie's visual artstry amazed me.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It exactly has the same strengths and weaknesses as the original three, plus breathtakingly spectacular visual design and special effects."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Lucas at his visionary best and at his maddening worst.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The movie has no heart, dark or otherwise, only state-of-the-art accouterments."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It does the job just fine. That job, as director George Lucas freely admits, is quite simply to thrill the beating hearts and the inquiring minds of 12-year-old boys."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Lucas has fashioned a fascinating pluriverse of outer space works filled with strange and amazing creatures and special effects.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"A murky, talky prequel that emphasises all the series' weakest elements rather than its strongest ones."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It's not perfect ... but it's still fantastic.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The Phantom Menace opened to the exact same complaints as its now canonical predecessor. Only this time, its very real assets have been almost completely dismissed."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"as a film it's a warmed over, albeit technically superior, rehash of sights and concepts we've seen before."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"...not in the same league as the original Star Wars. But, then, it was never meant to be."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"An often deliriously exciting adventure, hitting the target audience of 10-year olds and satisfying long-time fans."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It's a scam.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Overwhelmed by digital effects and watered down for children... the narrative structure is just awful
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The visual imagery comes off the screen in leaps and bounds, and it allows Lucas the freedom to construct intricately detailed action sequences that put the audience right in the action."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Let the movie speak to the child inside you -- the child that is still optimistic and that still believes in magic.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling extragalactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of Jurassic Park."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,A testimony to how far special effects have come.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Not bad for a toy commercial, and the SF settings, however familiar, are even more impressive than the gadgets and beasties."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,I can't convey the essence of the plot because I wasn't clear about it even as it was happening.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Who would have guessed that The Phantom Menace would be so incoherent, so completely bereft of a grand adventure's surging thrills?"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of The Phantom Menace.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"A great work from a greater director, and a blockbuster of quite the most swashbuckling kind."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"A breathless, exciting family movie with a couple of truly memorable sequences, and just enough in the way of story and character to keep the franchise going for another 20 years."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Story. Character. They used to mean something to George Lucas.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,An absolute disaster!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,This film has a strange air of nada about it.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Eye candy isn't a reward in and of itself -- it has to be backed by substance.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Being amazed has never been this boring.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Spectacular yet remote.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Joyless, overly reverential and impenetrably plotted!"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Everything seems to have been doubled.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The story was well told, the characters were for the most part nicely drawn, and the action was phenomenal."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,A very pleasing technical accomplishment.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The Phantom Menace proves that Lucas still knows how to capture the imagination of young and old.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,I wish Phantom Menace was a better film. The bones of a great film are there. But there's no beating the sense of hope and adventure and honest-to-goodness wonder that shines through.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The special effects are as awesome as you would expect, and this is an extremely slick production."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"There is nothing in this noisy, overdesigned bore to equal the excitement generated by the mere idea of the trailer."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"With ripping action, oddball aliens and three times the digital effects of any previous movie, The Phantom Menace generally lives up to the most eager anticipation of any movie since Gone With the Wind."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Lucas has gotten rusty, and it shows in quite a few places. But he still has the heart of a visionary, and when that shines through, The Phantom Menace is a wonder to behold."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It's got everything you've hoped for -- in gigabytes.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The John Williams score is dynamite, the sound is brilliant, the pictures are richly detailed and ferociously eye-popping!"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Was I disappointed? A little. Am I going to see it again? Yes. Two more times? Probably.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"This entry into the Star Wars saga does the originals justice in terms of heart, action, and fun."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"This is a film made for the fans. On that level, it doesn't disappoint."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Like a giant anchor in a sea of scattered Hollywood myths, Phantom Menace --the mere making of it -- promises viewers a point of reference of biblical proportions."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,An old-fashioned epic and like epics of yore it supplies its audiences with enough spectacle and awe.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Visually dazzling, inventive beyond imagining and full of resonant detail that recalls stories told or hints at those to come!"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It's wholesome and enjoyable entertainment for kids, rather than the slap in the face a truly bad movie would have been, but the fans deserve more."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Lucas has proved he has the Naboos to pull it off again.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,[Lucas] ought to spend more time on story and less time crunching binaries.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"More shrewd showman than a great filmmaker, Lucas employs these effects to create a total fantasy universe."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Wait till it's out on video. Then borrow it.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It is an understatement to say that the movie is a disappointment; it is the disappointment of the millennium.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"If I had to pick six words to describe this movie, they would be, 'too busy, too silly, no mystery.'"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Too bad writer-director Lucas left out the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out memorable characters. He left out the fun.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It's an extremely enjoyable movie, blending imagination with technology and creating visual eye candy, wrapped up in a lightweight but enjoyable story."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Star Wars of the next generation!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"At times this science-fiction adventure is thrilling, and it is also touching and even has its share of silly moments."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The actors are wallpaper, the jokes are juvenile, there's no romance, and the dialogue lands with the thud of a computer-instruction manual."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"With Phantom, Lucas has brought the series to the brink of total artificiality, the future as a video game."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Many of the scenes feel shapeless and flat-they're not ended, but abandoned."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Incomplete, but still fun."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"I warn you, I'm gonna continue whining about the movie. Just keep in mind that I liked it."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Far from a shattering blow to my faith in Star Wars, I believe that in time these new films will only make it stronger."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Finally someone has crossed the line where reality and fantasy are indistinguishable.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Creating a so-called modern legend, droning on about The Force and all the rest of it, is no substitute for the full engagement of our senses."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Lucas has made a deal with the devil, trading strong characterization and narrative for visual indulgence and verbal convolution."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Geared more to video-game fans than to grown-up moviegoers who remember when the best fantasy films had grander ambitions.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The Phantom Menace takes twists and turns you don't expect.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Lucas' directorial attention is clearly not focused on the cast, most of whom seem slightly adrift."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Everything about this film is so mechanical you wonder if it was written, directed and acted by 'droids.'"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,What's missing from George Lucas' heralded return to the screen is . . . sex.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,You keep looking for the emotional center of the movie and never find it.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"I'd have to say it's a better picture than Return of the Jedi while falling into the same third-act trap of juxtaposing a terrific swordfight with boring, slapstick scenes of combat."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,George Lucas is a wizard at populating a world with everything but people.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond. In energy, not yet."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Only time will tell if this movie deserves to be connected to the last three episodes, or, for that matter, if the final three episodes deserve to be connected to this one."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It actually undoes some of the myth and magic that the first three movies forged in the hearts and minds of millions of movie lovers.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,This movie is a perfect example of why the word 'eye-candy' was invented.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,I'm glad I saw this movie. You'll be glad you did too. It's an amazing adventure into technology and glitz.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"This installment... may not be the best in the series, but it certainly has its share of rewards. To enjoy the production, do your best to forget all the hype and just let the movie wash over you."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,This Star Wars engages by its sheer variety of characters.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Thoroughly entertaining!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Pure adventure!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Delivers exactly what every kid of any age wants: wows. And plenty of them!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It's slow. Its characters are anorexic. The dialogue is mostly forgettable. Jake Lloyd delivers something short of an exciting performance.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Packed with creative characters and breath-taking action sequences.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The technology is state-of-the-art, but the people around it are far from state-of-the-heart."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The lack of emotion is glaring.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,This isn't a film that will change history the way the first Star Wars did 22 years ago.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Phantom had me from the moment it touched down on Naboo.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Phantom Menace is unlikely to convince folks who waited in ticket lines for weeks that they made the right choice.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,This isn't so much a movie as a two-hour special-effects demonstration reel.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The force is gone and George Lucas apparently has no idea where he left it!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Even without aliens, though, the humanity in Phantom Menace would still be hard to find."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The perfect movie for families!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"To pull a switch on Obi-Wan, I have a good feeling about this."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The biggest letdown since the Clinton presidency!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,This pumped-up prequel is an essential history lesson fueled by a numbing sense of magic and myth.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It's well-made and entertaining!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,The Star Wars series is back with all of its virtues intact.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,This is a franchise in deep spiritual trouble.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"A vigorous, romping, hugely entertaining movie!"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,A solar bore!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It is neither captivating nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull, as well as the sense of wonder and awe that marks the best works of sci-fi/fantasy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Perhaps Lucas has become too lost in his mastery of computer-generated effects and digital sound to remember that creativity in the movies is not just a technical thing.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"For now, The Phantom Menace is a phantom movie, the merest hint of a terrific saga that the final two episodes of the new trilogy may reveal. At least, that's what we, and Hollywood, want to believe. Hype, after all, is just moviespeak for hope."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Exceptionally well-made, highly imaginative."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"A highly entertaining and visually breathtaking movie, capable at times of rocking and delighting you."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"After waiting 16 years for the overture to this epic saga, this is what we get? An in-progress trade war?"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Every scene teems with energy and speed, and the basic good-evil struggle at the core of the plot deepens and darkens."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The computer-generated creatures and characters are splendid, the kingdom of Naboo is a colorful paradise, and Trish Biggar's costume designs for Queen Amidala lets young actress Natalie Portman shine in her regal best."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace seems designed more as a promotion for Lucasfilm's billion-dollar merchandising concerns than a meaningful chapter in the Star Wars canon
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Outstanding!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Too busy and talky by half, overpopulated by a baffling array of aliens and robot 'droids,' The Phantom Menace fails to engage the audience in its mythic quest `to restore balance to the Force.'"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It's a kiddie movie rejiggered for childish grown-ups, of whom there are enough to make it a hit."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The end result looks like a great video game, but is as cold and emotionless as the computers that spit it out."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The wow-factor action is irresistible, and Lloyd is no less appealing than '60s Disney star Kevin Corcoran."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Even without the pre-release hoopla, The Phantom Menace would be a considerable letdown."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor give great performances as the pair of Jedi knights we follow throughout the tale.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It isn't the best in the series, but it delivers about what you would expect."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Still, you have to see it, don't you? I know I did, and I'm glad I did. But I can honestly say I was never really entertained."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Deeply flawed and occasionally inept, The Phantom Menace strikes me as no better--but not necessarily lessor--than any of the previous Star Wars movies."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"A film that not only couldn't stand up to the hype monster, but also couldn't stand up to multiple viewings."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"This time, the Force wasn't with him."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,Not only is it a fanciful phenomenon but it's also the most eye-popping spectacular special-effects picture ever made as George Lucas integrates the fantasy of computer imagery with reality.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Not a great film, but it is magical and majestic."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"The result is an adventure that feels...well, Forced."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Is it fun? For the most part, yes. Is it a life-changing experience? Only if you reach puberty, give birth or die while watching it."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"Flawed as it is, The Phantom Menace captured my imagination and I enjoyed it."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"It works as an action flick, visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting; it also works as an elicitor of memories, a piece of exquisite nostalgia."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,It's a frenetic visual feast indeed; there's nothing quite like it in the galaxy.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,"By purporting to be yet-another-episode in a larger saga it has franchised itself, a thought that is sure to get the critical bile rising"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE,I could still have enjoyed it if only there were actors or characters strong enough to stand out against this computer enhanced backdrop.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"... for me, it is definitely an improvement over the childish and irregular first episode."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"So what else works, besides [Ewan] McGregor's performance? Darn little, even compared to The Phantom Menace."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"His characters, as is now his norm, are plastic puppets, even in the confectionary love scenes. Most of their dialogue is so doughy that it could be spooned into comic-strip balloons. Lucas simply has no interest in these people."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,As perpetually uneven as its underwhelming predecessor...
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"The film is touching, spectacular and surprisingly coherent. It also has something the others lacked entirely: old-fashioned charm. This time, The Force is with us."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,The technical wizardry of the action scenes are ultimately more important than the story and reason enough for nonbelievers to see and enjoy the movie.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Easily the most polarizing Star Wars film -- all but 5% of the fan base loathes Phantom Menace -- Attack of the Clones remains the most underrated entry in the saga.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Attack of the Clones is indeed a pleasant surprise. It's fine.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"All in all, no one gets anything to do here."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Attack Of The Clones lacks the light heart of the ""old"" trilogy but this deliberate throwback to matinee movie serials is still fun."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"On points, this beats the underwhelming Episode I: more action, less politics and better gags."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"It's the sheer scale of the storytelling that makes this episode superior to its immediate predecessor, and then of course there's the look of the movie. The production design is superb, with a real sense of cinematic wonder."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Allowing for some dull moments, this movie has considerable visual style."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,The latest entry in George Lucas' transgalactic saga of the moral rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker and the deterioration of democracy into despotism has an electric visual majesty and boasts Lucas' best direction since American Graffiti.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Attack of the Clones is the best Star Wars installment since The Empire Strikes Back, hurtling along so quickly that you hardly notice the many moments when the story fails to make sense -- even on its own fantastical terms."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Lucas' obsession with digital technology has obliterated the saga's last remnants of human purpose and turned his once mesmerizing space opera into a pure, dehumanized cartoon."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"In lieu of a proper climax, Attack Of The Clones ends with a tantalizing cliffhanger for the next episode, but Lucas' lumbering series is presenting fewer and fewer reasons to tune in."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Better than Phantom, but still inferior to Episodes IV, V and VI."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,It's the last 20 minutes that save the film from too much visual information (though it is state-of-the-art awesome) and too much exposition (without the humor that made episodes IV-VI three of the best films ever made).
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"George Lucas puts away childish things and gets down to business with Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, the movie Jedi disciples waited 16 years to see and got Episode I instead."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"It's frustrating to watch a movie which has been so painstakingly crafted and is so extraordinarily designed and yet in which the storytelling is so sloppy, as if lost in the prosthetic and mechanical clutter on the screen."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"It's still a rush to sit in a packed theater (equipped with THX, naturally) when that first blast of John Williams' fanfare sounds. Then you have to endure the rest of the movie."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"You can't blame actors, particularly young ones, when the words put in their mouths are almost unspeakable and the direction seems to suck them dry of energy or spontaneity."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Sit back and enjoy fantastic, imaginative visuals."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,It starts off briskly with some fantastic special effects and a great high-speed chase but then founders on the shores of bad script writing.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Though, lacking in plotline it makes up for in action and entertainment."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Lucas does not always recognize his limitations. This tends to make films of mixed quality. Still, there is always enough that is excellent to make them worth seeing."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Attack of the Clones emerges looking as bad as if not worse than its 1999 predecessor, thanks to the lame romantic subplot, which is so badly written, directed and performed that it surpasses Jar-Jar Binks as the all-time low point in the series."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Makes The Phantom Menace seem like one long clearing of the throat before Lucas could begin to tell the real story.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,This time the exposition is so thick that everyone except acolytes may tune out.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"The special effects are remarkable, yet somehow numbing, and the film only partly lives up to the promise in the title of Lucas's company, Industrial Light and Magic."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"While it lacks the quality of Empire's script and performances, Clones is the most visually enthralling of the series so far."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,It is certainly better than the childish Phantom Menace and the final 45 minutes of straight action beat the editing nightmare at the end of the last film.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Christensen is a winning mix of sultry and sulky as the now older Anakin, while McGregor is finally beginning to relax as the mentor who understandably refuses to treat his moody pupil like a grown-up."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,The magic has definitely been recaptured.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"As convincing a job as they, Christensen, and Lee do, they all end up being upstaged by the jaw-dropping skills of a CGI creation: Yoda (again voiced by Frank Oz), who finally gets a chance to show exactly why he has such a legendary reputation."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,The muppet steals what's otherwise an underwhelming show.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Clones is far from perfect, but when it clicks, it revives the old spirit that made a generation become so obsessed with all things Star Wars in the first place."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"It's impossible...to dismiss a film with this much stuff: exotic production design, imaginative characters, and a wide variety of digital jedi fu."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"It would be easy to say that this film is fantastic and blows away the others, but unfortunately I cannot."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Superior to Episode I -- The Phantom Menace, with its annoying Jar Jar Binks and its dull, galaxy-hopping story line."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Enjoy this film they will.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Alternately excites and bores.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"I'll call it nearly good, based mostly on one hell of a last half-hour."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,It's no Empire Strikes Back but then you won't have to worry about Jar Jar too much either.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,How I wish I could say something other than ho-hum.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,You will most likely end up sitting through this latest installment - even if the series has become a shadow of its former self
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"My God, how wonderful it would be if it just even pretended to not be so commercialized."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,The Star Wars franchise continues to slip into obscurity with another underwhelming entry.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"When George Lucas learns to make his audience feel the way he does about creating his worlds and the living things that populate them, he just might be more at one with a larger creative force as well. The new films are good, but they're still clones."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Lucas has delivered new worlds, characters, and creatures but has left in little of the humor that sparkled throughout the original Star Wars."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,At least it's better than Return of the Jedi. If that sounds like faint praise... then line up and find out for yourself.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,I feel ambivalent about it and I'm still going to pay to see it again. It's just that important to our collective dorkitude.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Yes, it's better than The Phantom Menace. Think for a minute about how little that means."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Star Wars fans, prepare to weep with joy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,It has all the moves; it never quite catches the rhythm.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"...open your eyes and ears and disengage your mind...it's a splendid film, and enjoying it for its sheer beauty is much more fun than having to think about it."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"It's the breakdown of genre influences that expresses Clones' melodrama in grandiose, exciting terms."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"If Phantom Menace resulted in mindless boredom, then Attack of the Clones at least offers mindless entertainment."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,The Force is indeed with George Lucas.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"A tale full of sound and fury, sucking the life out of cinema."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,The second half of this film is almost a different movie. Everything about it is better. Everything.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"The least of the Star Wars series, but that is pretty damn good."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Star Wars fans will be in heaven.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,...less irritating than its immediate predecessor - but it may be going too far to say it's a better movie. It may be going too far to say it's a movie at all
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Basically, it's pretty but dumb."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Lucas returns the series to its roots, delivering a cartoon-like adventure that uses special effects to enhance rather than replace storytelling."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Meant for Star Wars fans. It is there to give them a good time.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"While it's not quite what the first three were, it's on the right track. This one definitely is an improvement from `Episode 1'."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"If you fell asleep within the first fifteen minutes or so of this movie, and only woke up before the last forty minutes or so, the truth is that you wouldn't miss much."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"The film is probably worth seeing for the sheer spectacle of it all, for the sake of obtaining valuable information, and for finding more closure on a story that has always been missing several pieces."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,This is the film Star Wars fans have been waiting for since 1980.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,It's still got enough magic to coast on sheer goodwill.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"As bright as a light saber, George Lucas strikes back with stunning imagery and the best ending yet to his popular series."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"The battling Yoda looks ludicrous, like Kermit the Frog in a Matrix fight scene."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"less Jar Jar, no discussion of taxes and trade blockades, and more Jedis, violence, and sex appeal"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Lucas has never been able to conjure another Han Solo, a character who could, with simply a wink, remind us that this was just an overgrown Saturday afternoon serial."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"In the end, what I appreciated most was the unpredictability of it all."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Clones largely brings everything together, deepening the arc of the entire story ... and restoring the mythological grandeur that helped establish the series in the first place."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"What Lucas needs to wrap up this franchise properly is a return to the fundamentals: less overplotted hooey, more thick blue liquid."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Action Good! Love Bad!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Attack of the Clones is light years ahead of its predecessor and a return to the fun Saturday matinee feel that the original films possessed. There's a bunch of surprises, and a good mix of action, laughs, romance, and suspense."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Mostly it flatlines.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Ewan McGregor neither sings, dances nor takes off his clothes in Star Wars: Episode 2. There are millions of dollars worth of often breathtaking special effects and about $1.75 worth of dialogue."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering, wheezy drag..."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"If you ignore the cheesy dialog and the political mumbo-jumbo, the power of the force has returned to the franchise."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,This might be the most visually stunning motion picture I have ever seen.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Episode II has a stronger storyline than Episode I, but suffers from weak performances and poor romantic chemistry."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"""Attack of the Clones"" is a substantial improvement over ""Episode I,"" with more action, less downtime, a potent dose of Jedi master Yoda and -- best of all -- only a couple of brief appearances by the idiotic amphibian Jar Jar Binks."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Two hours of nonsense and fifteen minutes that may sell a couple more bags of Yoda-endorsed Sour Cream and Onion Ruffles.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Preposterous love story aside, Clones is really not that bad."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Why does Lucas even bother planting the seeds if he refuses to let them sprout?
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,The good news? Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is eons better than Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace. The bad news? It's still not very good.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"Falls to new depths of narrative incoherence, torturous banality, and acting incompetence."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Stunning Visuals Overcome Stunted Emotion
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,Ewan McGregor simply oozes wisdom and integrity as Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"It's good, but before you get all trendy on me and skip a week of work to stand in line, I should really tell you that Attack of the Clones is (gasp!) not worth waiting in endless lines for."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES,"It's an ambitious film, and as with all ambitious films, it has some problems. But on the whole, you're gonna like this movie."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"As every fan is well aware, Natalie Portman is destined to reveal her twins, and not the twins we were all hoping to see, if you know what I mean."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"...clearly the best of the prequel trio, and for me almost as good as Return of the Jedi. But this is largely because there are no Ewoks involved."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Well done, George. Well done."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Easily the best of the prequels...

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"There's precious little of the wonder and charm of the original Stars Wars films in this big, loud, and mostly empty spectacle."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"When the aim is pure visual spectacle, the results are brilliantly exciting. When the aim is heart-touching drama, though, the movie falls apart."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,It's revenge of the Star Wars fan.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Flat performances and even flatter dialogue give the final Star Wars prequel a hollow ring.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"The lurid attraction of Revenge of the Sith stems from its utter predictability, from our knowledge that this is the payoff for which five earlier films over 28 years were but one elaborate Greek chorus."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the movie we've been waiting for, the movie that should have been made all along."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"For once, the words 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' seem ironic, and it's hard to watch what follows without drawing comparisons to our own political landscape."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Limbs are lost, people die, destruction is widespread, and evil reigns... all this violence is courtesy a mere PG-13 rating (thanks, MPAA!)"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Got Wood? Christensen's stiff acting almost sink this digital ship. The last hour is absolutely brilliant.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"This one is definitely the best of the three. Fear not, fans. Lucas came through in the clutch."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"It's meatier and more daring than [the first two prequels], and earns its place alongside the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Lucas' attempted apolitical veneer only underlines the point: wars are political, even in movies."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Too bad George Lucas was trying to write a tragedy and not a farce.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"While it does carry some of the flaws of the first two episodes, it thankfully lives up to its promise to be the darkest film in the series."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Lucas should be barred from touching a typewriter, but, based on his work here, I'd like to see him encouraged to shoot as many fight scenes as possible."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"An ideal, convincing finale for this franchise."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Lucas' vision has matured, along with his digital special-effects tools. Lucky for us that the Force was often with him on this one"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"You may walk away sad, or even depressed, but it's nothing that a Darth Vader Slurpee can't cheer up."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,...falls down in the one area that it can't afford to - making us feel something at the moment Anakin goes to the Dark Side.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,The circle is now complete.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Almost exactly what it needs to be, a powerful middle film to end one trilogy and presage another."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"A slam-bang summer blockbuster. Completes, deepens, and enriches the series beyond the pop-cultural phenomenon it has long-since made for itself."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Acquits the recent stinkiness of the series pretty well. I know, high praise indeed. But consider this - I knew what was going to happen, and I still cared."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Should satisfy all the fans and breed new ones. The Force is strong in this one.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Beautifully choreographed, loud, furious and rib-shaking donnybrooks that are weaved of the long-gestating daydreams of fans."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Remarkably, Lucas solicits even worse performances than in pictures past; the Mace Windu-Palpatine confrontation ranks amongst the worst acted scenes I've ever seen."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,The only disappointment - Natalie Portman does not wear the Princess Leia gold bikini.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Revenge of the Sith is so good, it almost redeems Episode I... Almost."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Not only a perfect bridge to the original trilogy but will draw favorable comparisons to the fabled excellence of The Empire Strikes Back.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"George Lucas is much more interested in the reflection of some planet's third moon on a window than in the other reasons people go to movies, like acting and script."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"The film is pretty much wall-to-wall action, with little of the filibusters about trade unions that made Phantom Menace and Clones so irritating."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Just when you thought it was safe to ridicule everything Star Wars, Lucas returns from his flirtation with the Dark Side by crafting a terrific caper to his monumental series."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"At its best, Revenge of the Sith reaches that plateau where pop is art."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Revenge of the Sith might be tolerable if it weren't designed to be taken seriously.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Otherwise known as I Was a Teenage Darth Vader, Star Wars III is dull, puerile and underwritten, not that it will matter to its lemming-like legion of fans."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"For fans it will be nirvana, and for everyone else a welcome relief."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"'Triumphant' is the word I'd use for Sith, particularly for its superb light-saber battles, which rediscover the sheer joy and physicality missing in Star Wars since Han Solo's heyday."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Revenge of the Sith is a brilliant consummation to a promise made a long time ago, far, far away, in a galaxy called 1977."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Revenge of the Sith, though, stands apart from its inert, tech-obsessed predecessors. It feels, at last, like the work of a man with a story to tell."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Watching Revenge of the Sith, it's hard not to wonder if Lucas even knows how good a movie he almost made."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"The darkest, most operatic, and technologically richest Star Wars movie to date, Sith is grim, stirring entertainment and a nearly complete vindication."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,The movie grabs us from its heart-pounding opening sequence and pulls us inexorably along its trajectory with the grip of the last gruesome act of a Greek tragedy.

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"George Lucas had lost his way for many years, gone to filmmaking's dark side. But now he's mustered up completely unexpected reserve for a last-minute redemption."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Though flawed, Episode III never betrays the Star Wars legacy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Even if this movie is short of perfection, it makes Star Wars complete."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Ultimately, Revenge of the Sith resonates with surprising emotional power and an undeniable sense of finality."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,The finale feels less the inevitable conclusion of some great saga than the predictable mooing of a reliable cash cow.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Revenge of the Sith overcomes its dime-store dialogue and less than convincing performances through the sheer force of its director's vision.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,It's better than Episode I and not quite as good as Episode II. What it isn't is a lot of fun.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"More than a first-rate wrap-up job, it stands on its own as a dazzling piece of showmanship."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Revenge of the Sith completes the big picture and will undoubtedly find favor with a majority of fans. But it isn't a very good movie.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Revenge of the Sith is more of the same: wildly flamboyant effects serving weak characters, bad acting and obtuse plotting."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Man: 'You're so beautiful.' Woman: 'It's only because I'm so in love.' Man: 'No, it's because I'm so in love with you.' Me: 'Man oh man.'"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,George Lucas makes it easy to experience Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith as a rush of deliverance -- even if the movie itself doesn't fully deliver.

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,It's good. I mean really good.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Call it the saga's 'Darth nadir.' Lucas's greatest success in Sith is this: We can't help but sympathize with Anakin as he surrenders to the Dark Side.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"I'm still not totally convinced that this is the result of good filmmaking, so much as it simply makes viewers nostalgic for the original trilogy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,It's all about seeing the story lines of the sloppy prequels finally tie together with the original films. [F]ans will enjoy [watching] everything fall neatly into place.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"It's all kind of like comfort food as Episode 3 finally brings you back 'to a galaxy far, far away' that we first met nearly three decades ago."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,...writer/director George Lucas has been promising a darker film and Hayden Christensen's critical vindication. He delivers on the first promise.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,A satisfying finale... a happy payoff for fans who found Phantom Menace and the first half of Attack of the Clones to be plodding exposition.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Technically magnificent but dramatically inert, it's a lumberingly predictable finale to the space saga that peaked in 1980 and has been going downhill ever since."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,A great film in spite of itself.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"The good George Lucas usually wins out, even if the story focuses on the Dark Side of the Force."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Precisely what this passionate SW geek wanted: a bit less soapy dialogue, a lot more action, and a stunningly strong infusion of drama, emotion, and tragedy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"I cried for two reasons. First, because, after nearly 30 years, it's finished. Yes, the series will be out in 3-D. But this is the finale of what George Lucas began in 1977."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Lacking in dramatic punch, animated only by mind-numbing action sequences and endless light-saber fights."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,What a shock when George Lucas finds his footing and the saga once again takes hold.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"It provides fun and closure, wrapping up the saga's many narrative strings in an entertaining finale."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Despite all of its impressive slam-bang, almost wall-to-wall action and awe-inspiring special effects, Episode III, though head and shoulders above the other prequels, is crippled by poor scripting and logic."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Same logo. Same starry-night spacescape. Same music. Same crawl. Same everything. Only different. And so much better.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Revenge of the Sith is both unspeakably brilliant and kind of OK, depending on where you're coming from."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"An engaging sense of closure to a tale that has captivated more than one generation, and one that has made cinematic history"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"[T]here is a haunting, disconcerting bittersweetness to the film that is impossible to shake. It's a particularly GenX response, I suspect..."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,We are all preprogrammed in one way or another to want Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith to climax in the way it does. All George had to do was not screw that up. He didn't.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Heretical though it sounds, [Sith] may come closest of all the films to achieving the balance between gee-whiz sci-fi spectacle and mythic resonance to which Lucas aspired."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"For many, the Sith finale will redeem all three prequels. Others will wonder why Lucas wasted so many dollars, years and pixels on a story that could have been told in one film, or better yet, not at all."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Lucas still can't write. His dialogue crashes and burns like an X-wing zapped out of the sky by a star destroyer.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Star Wars, for better or worse, was the genuine article. How then can there not be a relevance, and a resonance, in saying goodbye?"

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Star Wars, people, is back."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Revenge of the Sith is the most energetic of the prequels, the only one at all worth watching. But that doesn't mean it is without the weaknesses that scuttled its pair of predecessors."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"...the dialogue is astonishingly feeble, the acting unforgivably woode"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"The scariest, most exciting, most visually prodigious of the sextet, with action sequences that explode off the screen, characters who finally awaken your sentiments."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,George Lucas has achieved what few artists do; he has created and populated a world of his own.

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed. That's right: it's better than Star Wars."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Revenge Of The Sith is brilliant. It's as if it took Lucas two goes to get comfortable in the director's chair and can now actually apply a bit of style to the proceedings.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Anakin's defection from Jediism to Sithdom should provide the film's backbone, but neither the script nor Christensen delivers the needed nuance."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Revenge of the Sith is not the ""masterpiece"" some make it out to be. It is, simply, a far more worthy installment than we've recently been fed."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Thank the movie gods this one is better than the two previous Star Wars films.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"An exhilarating, inexorably dark, somewhat distressing rollercoaster ride of fun ... the film Star Wars fans have been waiting for."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"May be the fourth best film in the series. It's still a tossup with Ewok Adventure, but I haven't seen that in a while so it may not hold up as well."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,It may well be the best of all six Star Wars movies.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"At last ... Lucas brings forth the long-awaited, well-earned kick-*** conclusion to the latest Star Wars trilogy. Fans will cheer!"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Revenge of the Sith was the film that should have salvaged the prequels. It doesn't.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,So sound in its construction and...[its] space-operatic catharsis that even the nitpickiest fanboy will likely adopt a humbly mumbled 'All is forgiven' as a daily mantra
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,"Lucas manages to turn the audience's familiarity to his advantage: like a jigsaw puzzle whose final form has always been known, the fun is in discovering how the last pieces fit."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,Perhaps the Dark Side is stronger after all; it certainly makes the conclusion of this journey a memorable one.

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH,We already know how this film turns out and no one at Lucasfilm has the wit to make the journey interesting.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"A key moment... has all the poignancy of discovering an old toy in the attic-or in this case, in the middle of a desert-and finding not only that it still works, but it has a role in saving the universe."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"It's a grand adventure that illustrates how some things might stay the same, but other things can always, always change for the better."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"It's both nostalgic and fresh, a tender homage to, especially, the initial Star Wars (""Episode IV: A New Hope""), as well as a bridge to help those of us stuck in the splendor of Hoth edge into the future."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"What crystallizes the film, especially for veterans of the Star Wars franchise is the sense of history and consequence from the last film in the storyline."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,A truly wonderful movie-one worthy of its years-long hype and the Star Wars name itself.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"The Star Wars film we needed (a palate cleanser). Funny, full of action and lots of feels, this new entry achieves great balance between nostalgia and novelty. "

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"The final product is that The Force Awakens is emotionally satisfying, but you kind of have to play dumb to get along with it. It's a good movie-a really good one, on the surface level-but it falls just short of great."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,Abrams seems far more intent on delivering on the promise of the originals as rousing space Westerns where good and evil stood opposite one another and dared the other side to blink.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"Even if TFA is mostly fan service, I'll take it."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,Thank the Maker the Galaxy still has life in it.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"In short, The Force Awakens does what it needs to do. The familial saga of parents and children, power sought and power won, still sing to us on a genetic level."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"Abrams makes the Star Wars movie every fan wants to see, and it succeeds effortlessly at doing more than merely cashing in on nostalgia."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"What we've got here is a film that managed, on the first try, to turn the engine over in a car that has been collecting dust for 32 years. Now, they didn't drive it anywhere, so we can't tell if it was worth the effort."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"What is the Force, and Jedi-ism? In Star Wars, it refers to the ability of a high-level martial-artist-knight to use supernormal abilities. Science has proven 6 of them."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"Abrams is trying to recreate that experience for a whole new generation eager to be captured by the charge and action and exotic Amazing Stories covers come to life in a fairy tale space fantasy that takes place long ago and a galaxy far, far away..."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,Humour and heart are prominent amid the breathtaking action.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"[Abrams'] plot mirrors that of A New Hope, but deliberately so: it will charm old fans, win many new ones, and make everyone an awful lot of money."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"If what's contained is ultimately the planting of seeds that will continue growing two, four, or forty years down the line, I suspect this franchise is in its best-ever state."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"This latest installment of fandom's favorite mongrel pet is a poorly paced MacGuffin-chase plot, ginned up with groan-inducing spoonful doses of pro-war imagery and its attendant rudimentary vocabulary."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,Bravo! Ford ignites the movie! He's the star and jumps right back into the iconic role. Disney brought a princess but it was a bait and switch. They got General Great-Greatma instead.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"As a one-off, the movie might seem like a little miracle - a fresh take on nostalgia not too different in tone from last year's delightful Turbo Kid. But stretched out... a hard crust of cynicism is apparent just beneath the sugar-dusted surface."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"as long as the viewer does not need to contend with Jar-Jar Binks or a pod race, any Star Wars film delivers more than a ticket's worth of entertainment."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"It all comes together nicely as the actors breathe vulnerability, fallibility and personality into their roles, with Daisy Ridley being quite the commanding presence. My favourite, hands down, is the cute and rotund droid BB-8."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,It's precisely what you expect. Nothing more. Nothing less. And there isn't anything wrong with that.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"The Force Awakens is an exciting, nostalgic, powerful and moving film, that is capable of generating accelerated heartbeats and knots in the throat."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"While Star Wars: The Force Awakens gets temporarily bogged down taking us back to the world that we left in 1983, it introduces us to the new and exciting torch-bearers of the franchise."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,A thrilling outer space epic breathing new life into a once flagging franchise!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"This was not a movie made under the weight of calculated strategy; it was given life by those who took immense pride in their association, and sought to enhance an established legacy with grand enthusiasm."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"It's like [Abrams] put Episodes IV, V, and VI in a blender. It's an act of love, no doubt about it. ... [But it] lacks any image of its own that is truly iconic."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,There's no end in sight. The force has awakened.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"J.J. Abrams and his crew have restored the shine to our beloved story.The Force is awakened, indeed."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"...the tendency for the narrative to repeat the beats of A New Hope, though perfectly logical in a saga founded upon the constancy of the hero's journey, comes off as pandering fan-fiction."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"This is very similar to the first Star Wars film, but it isn't as family friendly. Hope and optimism are lacking in this reboot. What it lacks in optimism, it makes up for with hype, having been promoted along with every product known to man."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,...secret threads on social media are already picking their nits and debating theories; it's going to be a tough wait to see what happens next.

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"Abrams plays it safe, but it's a good kind of safe, because, for the first time in ages, the Star Wars saga has personable leads."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,It does exactly what it needs to be a crowd-pleaser in that regard. But whether it breaks any new ground ... not so much.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,I didn't mind the many nods to the original two movies -- at least they nick story points from the right ones.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,Another Death Star-like super weapon?! When will the Empire learn to quit designing them with weak spots where a few well aimed strikes can destroy the entire thing!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,The Force Awakens begins another epic chapter in the Star Wars saga in the best possible way.

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"The film is basically a ""greatest hits"" compilation of episodes IV and V, and little else."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"The light saber is drawn, the battle stance is set, and the Force is most definitely strong with this one."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"A sweeping return to form for the film series, one that is absolutely excellent and will hopefully open the door for more exciting conflicts."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"... a complete fan-service that combines the exciting storytelling and use of practical effects from the original trilogy with the crisp, vibrant color palette and clean computer graphics of the prequels."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"I found myself listening to a chorus of spontaneous gasps, cheers, laughs, whoops and even occasional cries of anguish. What's really surprising is that many of them were coming from me."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"And just like that, the scars of 16 years and lesser trilogies were magically washed away. We've seen much of what's onscreen before, but Abrams brings a fresh energy to pacing and performances that reminds us of the joy of watching Star Wars films"

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"The story is compelling. The acting is great. The technical aspects are solid. But it's hard to escape the idea that the film is a remix of something else, an attempt to rework story elements that felt more original elsewhere."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"Dramatically, the film does pull some great aces from up its sleeve...The film also proves what a lot of Star Wars fans have long suspected - that the best thing that could happen to Star Wars would be to take George Lucas out of it."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,"The nostalgic callbacks are so insistent that they can stop the narrative dead, like when some real drama is about to go down but everything pauses so we can have a meet-cute with C-3PO. Even the main villain comes off as some emo Darth Vader fanboy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS,It's a solid space opera spectacle with enough nostalgia to overpower even the most hard-hearted child of the '70s and '80s but it relies a little too much on recycling old plot elements.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"In the first 'Star Wars' film, in 1977, heroism is rewarded (literally, in the form of a medal); but here, heroism requires extreme sacrifice. That (ultimately lethal) distinction is a key to the difference between previous chapters and this sidebar..."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"As the lost piece of an intricate puzzle, Rogue One satisfyingly presses into its rightful place in the series' universe. Filling in that blank space might never have seemed necessary, but, once you've seen it, there's no denying the richness added."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Though it's certainly worth a look, ""Rogue One"" is a minor ""Star Wars"" story."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A deep cut for Star Wars fanatics,"
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This latest ""origin story"" features no storytelling development but simply repeats Star Wars formulae...Rogue One, a huckster's tale, confirms the Disney Corporation's routine indoctrination of its captive audience."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Fans of the Star Wars films--and don't be ashamed to admit it if you are one-- will see a more complete expansion of the mainline story and a lot of visual excitement.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Since Rogue One slides neatly into the preexisting plot of the original Star Wars trilogy, it doesn't feel glaringly imitative of it, as The Force Awakens did."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is mostly sparing and on-the-nose, in that sense it's reliable but don't expect it to surprise you in any meaningful way."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The first act is the frenetic embodiment of the Hollywood machine, but the final 30 minutes is a rousing climactic battle on the empire's home turf."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,It's already apparent that Disney's plans for Star Wars are cause for excitement.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One isn't taking any chances: It's desperate to ensure a seamless transition with Episode IV, as if this constitutes a meaningful end in itself."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Apart from Ben Mendelsohn's weaselly Orson Krennic [and perhaps Donnie Yen]... the faces are unmemorable and the characters unexceptional, their meaningful glances unearned."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"When Rogue One is good, it is VERY good. When it is bad, it is... well not prequel trilogy-bad, at least."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"An original story about ""ordinary beings achieving extraordinary things"" that only exists in science fiction, without jedis and Skywalker. "

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"While there is some humor in the movie, I would have liked more of that and less of the several scenes featuring characters stoically waiting to die. I can't really blame them for their fatalistic outlook since the Empire is indestructible."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The first 'Star Wars Story' is a success.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Jones, Mendelsohn and Forest Whitaker (as a militia leader) stand out in a strong cast."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is largely free of the weight of myth and expectation that were borne by The Force Awakens, and this turns out to be both a good and a bad thing."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,You never knew Donnie Yen whomping stormtroopers was something you needed in your life until you saw it happening.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"These Star Wars movies are pretty much the same story each time nowadays. This one has new names for basically the same characters, played by different actors...the same bad guys. How many times can they make the same movie and get people to pay?"
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"While Rogue One never comes close to matching the heights of the series at its most dazzling (basically, Episodes IV and V, with honorable mention to Episode VII), it's still a worthy addition to the canon."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Not just a dull but an oppressive experience, being force-fed a corporate product: a film that never comes alive, with none of the characters properly developed, none of the relationships gelling, the very adventure formulaic."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A cleverly conceived one-off that forges its own identity with a new set of characters, a contained storyline and a kind of stripped-down tone and visual approach free of the grandiosity of the series."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Edwards appears to have elevated what could have been simply a cash-in into something that feels essential, even magical. It has the distinct smell of victory."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's a giant universe out there, but in these movies it just keeps getting smaller."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Jyn represents a new breed of (almost gender-neutral) hero: dogged, tenacious, resolute. And in a world as bleak as this one, that's what amounts to hope."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Its characters are largely new, which means the movie can do with them as it wants. It isn't hemmed in the way most prequels are."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One does a brilliant job capturing the look and feel of Star Wars, but narratively, it's a footnote, and some of the creative choices are baffling."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Much of Rogue One is a push-me pull-you with George Lucas' original films.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"With all the aerial dogfights, armored combat vehicles, grenades, flame-throwers and snipers, Rogue One feels like a film for those who think that most Star Wars movies are insufficiently like World War II flicks."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Ben Mendelsohn is satisfyingly nasty as the film's principal villain, and while I'd like to have seen a little more of Mads Mikkelsen, an ensemble cast of proper actors gives the film authenticity, and grit."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It ranks among the series' best -- just below A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back (Episodes IV and V), and just above The Force Awakens."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"From a visual standpoint it's stunning, as the production values are a real knockout. Plus the battle scenes are really well executed. That said the plot is not always that engaging."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This off-shoot is a heck of a fun science-fiction film, and the last third of the movie is a wild, epic battle."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Suffice it to say, if the filmmakers had actually put up this tangle of a screenplay to K-2SO to rate his opinion, it wouldn't have been encouraging."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Maybe its modesty is the key to the success of ""Rogue One,"" that it doesn't seek to build on the mythology of the other seven films, but simply fill in a gap."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Epic but violent adventure offers diversity, role models."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The 2:13 length and cookie cutter characters and events suck the life out of an underwhelming story. Great effects but the Force just isn't with this one.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This standalone prequel/sequel takes a few beats to get going but once it does, Star Wars fans are taken on an intense, thrilling ride."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Trading emotion and depth for sci-fi magic and bombast, Rogue One is the start of a darker, more grown-up direction for the saga, and I applaud it."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"There's genuine fun here, but the humor is cynical, the heroics are tinged with regret, and it's all delivered with a cold smack of - yes - political relevance."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is thrilling, harrowing, and slightly rushed, a beautifully shot film that could have given its characters more time to develop."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"If you've ever wondered where Princess Leia got those Death Star plans from, well, here you go. Hope I'm not spoiling anything."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"I had a bad feeling about this, but Rogue One proves it belongs in the Star Wars universe."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Stylistic touches and new characters make 'Rogue One' seem fresh, which also invigorates the ongoing franchise."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"We must trust this series, a series that made us fall in love with scruffy-looking nerf herders, trigger happy fuzzballs and pessimistic droids. We must trust the Force."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"By the note-perfect closing moments, ""Rogue One"" has transformed into a richly rewarding experience."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"As we rebels prepare to fight the empire of Trump, the film is more pertinent than ever."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The Force is with ""Rogue One"" because by looking back, it helps carry the ""Star Wars"" saga forward."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is technically a spin-off but it is a rip-roaring, do-or-die adventure yarn in the best tradition of the space-age saga."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Gareth Edwards has expanded his story to its maximum while keeping it lean, raw and morally murky, outdoing The Force Awakens in the most satisfying installment since The Empire Strikes Back."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A seriously rousing action film with a riveting cast of characters and a surprising willingness to embrace even the darkest elements of storytelling.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"With strong work from Jones, Luna, Mikkelsen and Mendelsohn, a handful of exciting set-pieces... and plenty of expensive CG (surprise, surprise), this still doesn't quite work as the epic it so wants to be."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"There's a sense of familiarity and a refreshing sense of being offered something we haven't quite seen before, and that Rogue One is actually entertaining about it makes the experience all the sweeter."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The film isn't as excting as Episode VII, but there are a few reasons to get excited about it: the incredible stages, Death troopers and a pair of cameos that serve as anchor to this universe. "
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"With amazing battles that live up to the original saga, this film is more than a close relative worthy of Star Wars."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The good news is that Edwards' effort to make a storm-the-beach war film produces a tense third act that earns most of its big moments and also justifies much of what's come before.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"As a prequel, it brings depth and strength to the existing canon, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will probably leave fans wishing it could have spun off into a franchise of its own."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's a film that should further the genuine sense of excitement surrounding this particular franchise revival, while standing as something of a classic in its own right."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The Force is strong in this spin-off.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A a tense, well-made spacefaring war movie about a desperate and demoralized band of insurgents standing up against a rising authoritarian regime."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This is the Star Wars film to be excited for since a galaxy far, far away has never looked as promising as it does now. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is everything The Force Awakens should have been and then some."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Certainly there is pleasure in revisiting a favorite place you've been many times before. But it's not an 'event' film. For the first time, it really does just feel like an episode."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Audiences once packed theaters to gawk at the future; now, it's to soak in the past. The emphasis is on packing in as much nostalgia as possible and tersely editing it together to resemble a film."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A film with amazing performances and an absolutely memorable ending, where action, emotion, joy and sadness embrace in a totemic spectacle."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Sadly, that Felicity Jones isn't a standout as Rogue One's lead speaks to how more effort seems to have been spent on fan service than character development..."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A fun ride that repeats the Star Wars legacy without really adding to it.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's an enthralling go, with little pops of surprise and revelation that should please, nostalgically so."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,An energetic and very surprising film from the galactic saga with the very successful and simple resource of telling the same story. 
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One may be more intense than fun, but it's the best Star Wars prequel film by a long shot."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is what the fans expected and more.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A serious and occasionally spectacular addition to the Star Wars universe that only suffers in comparison to the original saga when measured by the charisma and likability of its characters.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,This is a movie made for fans.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Tudyk's K-2S0 has in miniature what Edwards's movie lacks overall: the soul of a new machine.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"""Rogue One"" spins ""Star Wars"" into a whole new orbit."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Star Wars Wars is such an immersive world heavy in lore and esoteric facts that being able to balance fan service without scaring off the casual moviegoer is no easy feat. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story manages to do exactly that.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's a real shame the character side of things is so weak, because otherwise this is a strong addition to the franchise."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Some sci-fi/fantasy fans may wonder if every last drop has already been milked out of the Star Wars franchise. But, judging from this energetic standalone tangent/prequel, more can be exploited for many years to come."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"[K-2SO] has all the good lines. I'm not sure if it's such a good thing that the best character in a sci-fi movie is a robot. But then again, the best character in 2001: A Space Odyssey was HAL, and that film wasn't half-bad."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Except for a few jocose, fan-serving moments, the movie is a dour affair, lacking the charm and chills of J.J. Abrams's spirited Star Wars: The Force Awakens, not to mention George Lucas's founding trilogy."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Like an Imperial Star Destroyer, it starts off slow and somewhat clunky, but by the time the mind-blowing third act arrives, it's all a fan can do not to stand up and cheer."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Often it looks dingy and cheap. Speed of action ought to compensate. But when the action is standardised chases-through-space, turgid and repetitive, that doesn't compensate for anything."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"[Rogue One] is sometimes as admirable as it is enjoyable, but it also has some glaring problems that are clearly holding the movie back from reaching its full potential."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,This prequel delivers more levels than the Death Star's elevator.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"One of the most exhilarating in the series, a film with a real sense of how to tell a story - and tell it well."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Familiar Star Wars action scenarios are revisited, revamped and revitalised courtesy of bleeding edge effects and genuine love for the material."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One does a great job of walking the fine line between being a Star Wars film and not feeling like any other Star Wars film.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A highly entertaining mess...the kind of loopy, stumblebum spectacle you get when state-of-the-art visual effects collide head-on with the erratic sensibilities of a resolutely mediocre director and the crushing need for a studio to meet a release date."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The rebel yell is a little croaky.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It also works as its own stand-alone film. One which, despite some lumpy pacing in its first half, turns out to be possibly the best Star Wars war film of the bunch."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One works best because its story is so narrowly focused.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is an explosive, brilliant entry into the Star Wars universe. It's a bracing slap in the face, but a bloody fun one to watch"
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The good news is that it's something genuinely fresh, a Star Wars story unlike any big screen adventure yet."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"In short, this movie is what the Star Wars prequels should have been, and that's meant as high praise indeed."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The resonant and entertaining Rogue One is about the persistence of hope and faith in the darkest of hours. As we stagger to the end of this epically turbulent year, the movie is all but guaranteed to strike a chord."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Efficiently made...but it comes across as an assembly-line product, an elaborate but fairly conventional action-adventure movie too dependent for its effect on references to earlier entries in the series."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"That's what people love about these Star Wars movies, right? We get older, they stay the same."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One packs an emotional punch and shows much promise for stories to come from a rich universe with an astonishing cultural impact.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Dark, gritty and heavy on the nostalgia, what Rogue One lacks in dialogue it makes up for in action."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,a boots-on-the-ground war story about flawed and forgotten heroes
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The performances in this film are among the best the franchise has seen. This isn't a film of supermen. It's one of everyday people trying to justify, morally and practically, their roles in the struggles against an overwhelming, evil adversary."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The film comes home strong, with large-scale warfare, feats of great daring and sacrifice, and acres of dead storm-troopers."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,I enjoyed the film that nicely balances being its own standalone offering and one that pays homage to and serves as an important thread in the sci-fi series.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is entertaining enough, but there is not much surprise as to how things turn out."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Hemmed in by a script that assigns truly theatrical sinisterness to pre-existing creations (i.e. Darth Vader) Ben Mendelsohn doesn't get to go 'the full Mendo', filled with pure, baleful, blackhearted menace, but hot damn - it's good to have him on board."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is what the fans were waiting for. Ideal for the ones that aren't passionate about the saga because they will find reasons to fall in love with this universe. 
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Above all else, it is on a technical level that Rogue One truly excels, allowing Edwards to conjure a sizeable number of intergalactic spectacles that are as stirring as they are stylish."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Imitation, they say, is the highest form of flattery. If so, the makers of ""Rogue One"" flatter the heck out of its predecessors."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Gareth Edwards tries to generate suspense by using well-worn movie cliches that display a lack of imagination and point to the flaws of telling this tale in the first place.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One is still an achievement. Every other Star Wars movie has only ever had the responsibility of telling part of a story - this manages the whole thing in one go.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A fun outing, if also a derivative one. Donnie Yen and the droid steal the film from the leads..."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,There's a comfort in being in the Star Wars Universe and you immediately feel a renewed affection for it upon re-entry. But a Star Wars film shouldn't rely on its Star Wars-yness.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One does not extend the Star Wars story but there are times when it deepens it.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The story clicks nicely into place with the events of Star Wars but that narrative is really just a blank sky in which the film's other elements can sparkle like stars.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One might not necessarily be a film that was needed but once the credits roll, you realise how much you desperately wanted it regardless."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Nothing is exultant, dramatic, epic, heroic, complex or just entertaining to me. The film is overwhelmingly empty, and lacks minimal grace and rhythm. "
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is one of the best films of our favorite space saga and will undoubtedly delight the fans, even on the verge of a nostalgic and involuntary tear of emotion."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is like its heroes. It is flawed in some ways, but it's still well worth the wait."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It suffers, like many blockbusters, from too much spectacle and not enough truth, but its greatest sin is that it feels dull, insipid and underwhelming despite a plethora of loud action scenes and dazzling visual effects."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"enhances as well as annotates the Star Wars mythos, making the story we thought we knew in A NEW HOPE richer and more urgent."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"In previous Star Wars movies, one side wore black hats and the other wore white...Here that's not the case. For some, this is a selling point. For me, it's close to a deal-breaker."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"There's nothing to sink our teeth into, especially when we already know how it ends. There's no suspense."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One is at its best when it's at war .
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Admittedly, this can be viewed as simply another rehash of old stories and themes, but hash is rarely this tasty."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A Star Wars story for the ages.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The movie the prequels should have been. Perfectly captures the spirit of the original trilogy and delivers a genuinely thrilling Star Wars film.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is Star Wars for hard core fans who felt left behind by the prequels, but it's got little to offer casual viewers beyond competent, uninspired thrills."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Of space dust, Joni Mitchell and the Force: a visually splendid, dramatically stirring journey spanning both yesteryear and tomorrow."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A movie experience that is supremely captivating.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Coming from someone who is not really a Star Wars freak, I have to say I was impressed. This could be the best one yet."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,There is always the danger with a film of this high profile to expect or want it to over-deliver. Sadly - though understandably - Rogue One just doesn't do that.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One accomplishes what fans have wanted to see for a few decades now: making Darth Vader scary again.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's the trio of Tudyk, Wen and especially Yen who steal the show, each bringing to life characters that will likely go down as three of the best ever to grace a story set in the Star Wars universe."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,This is a gorgeous and immersive film.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Though not meant to be an episode in the great intergalactic narrative of the series of trilogies, Edwards' Rogue One is an enthralling companion piece that fully embodies the Star Wars spirit and delivers the rousing pleasures."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Technically brilliant, Rogue One delivers the spectacle and the aerial combat that are such signatures of the Star Wars ethos, with some eye pleasing vistas of a hectic part of the stunningly beautiful universe"
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"New diverse actors from around our world breathe new life into prequel that just entertainingly barely satisfactorily, repeats the tried and true themes and expensive action."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This spin-off/prequel has the same primitive, lived-in, emotional, loopy, let's-put-on-a-show spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Of the three sidekicks, Yen's rueful but deadly martial artist leaves the best action impression."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One somehow delivers on almost all of its weighty pre-release promises whilst at the same time besting The Force Awakens for sheer spectacle.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A hugely enjoyable film, and an impressive sign of things to come. This is the perfect film for a Star Wars fan."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's an experiment that mostly works, but there are moments when it's clear that the task of finding new areas of ""Star Wars"" to play with is a bit too much for director Gareth Edwards to handle."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"We already knew this was going to be a thrilling epic, but I had no idea of the emotional punch it would pack."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"I enjoyed this scrappy little movie, the second consecutive one to feature a female heroine."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One left me feeling giddy with joy at seeing the Star Wars franchise expanded with such a genuine sense of affection and understanding for what made us fall in love with a galaxy far, far away."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,It offers more details of interoffice politics among the squabbling factions of both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance than probably anyone but a mid-level manager cares for. Yet you generally feel you're in good hands.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Star Wars movies have been dazzling, infuriating, heartbreaking, silly, witty, convoluted, gripping and overblown. But until Rogue One: A Star Wars story, I don't think ""dull"" was the most appropriate adjective."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"[Rogue One has] well-placed humor, inside jokes, aliens, droids and creepy CGI renderings of two key Star Wars characters, all set against the backdrops of mind-bending production designs and hypnotic visual effects."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's a downer. It's morally tangled. The characters are as depressed as the scenario, and Michael Giacchino's music can't make it better."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Disney refuses to waver from what makes 'Star Wars' matter - the battle between good and evil. Where can we send the 'thank you' notes?
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"If you're not a fan, Rogue One may not be the revelation that The Force Awakens turned out to be. But it won't have you wishing for your own personal Death Star either."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,...while it's great to see Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen placed into Star Wars lore as a catalyst for the Rebel Alliance the British Jones lacks the fire Daisy Ridley brought to Chapter VII.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Lucasfilm has outdone themselves. They've delivered a thrilling installment that embodies the best of Star Wars. Rogue One surpasses every expectation.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"What results is a poignant, powerful paean to the Star Wars Universe, set in a world where the best thing you can hope for is hope itself. It's a perfect and complete standalone, but it changes everything."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"If The Force Awakens was an exercise in giving Star Wars fans exactly what they want, Rogue One does its best to show them what else there is in the galaxy."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Credit to Jones, then, for imbuing the character with a steely melancholy. Moreover, her chemistry with bad-boy Andor visibly sizzles, so that you feel genuine investment in their story."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The new characters are nicely fleshed out, particularly Jones's Jyn, whose initial cynicism gradually morphs into a steely resolve, its seed planted by the memory of her father, but watered by the idealism of the Rebellion."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A classic adventure story and worthy spin off of one of the most popular sagas of contemporary cinema.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"""Rogue One"" is definitive proof: ""Star Wars"" is back, baby."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"When you realize where it's all been heading -- ending on a moment that's as transcendent as anything in 40 years of the franchise -- you'll be so, so happy."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is one of the best Star Wars flicks to date -- as well as the grittiest, darkest, and most grounded."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One features stirring action scenes, vivid characterisation and one or two truly eye-popping explosions. Nonetheless, what it lacks is any real originality."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Doesn't break the mold in terms of franchise formula, and it's an enjoyable installment in the ""Star Wars"" canon. However, it's not much more than that."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"'Because it's awesome' is enough reason for Rogue One, and it is awesome. The final space battle is the best space battle of any Star Wars movie."

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"""Rogue One"" is pure, unbridled ""Star Wars."""
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"For all that feels uninspired and unnecessary in Rogue One, it's no disaster."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Gareth Edwards' venture into a galaxy far, far away is the Star Wars film we never knew we needed. It's a triumphantly thrilling, serious-minded war movie that is incalculably stronger for the fact that it's NOT the first chapter in a new franchise."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One is a bright light in the Star Wars canon.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Edwards has created the rare Star Wars property that can be appreciated as a film. And it is about as violent and downbeat as Star Wars gets on the big screen-more downbeat than The Empire Strikes Back, in fact."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Let's face it: Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie in a long, long time."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Towering like a stick-man over the rest of the cast, K-2SO provides most of the laughs in this portentous voyage into that same old galaxy far, far away."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One, directed by Gareth Edwards with a sharp script by Tony Gilroy and Chris Weitz, is a bracing and dizzying marvel, propulsively pitched and even, I dare say, moving."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"In the end, this hardening of the franchise seems likely to alienate both the fans and the uninitiated."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A more than worthy adventure but lacks the brilliance of the original trilogy. It makes us have a good time, but not a memorable one. "
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" shows that the ""Star Wars"" universe can produce authentic adult entertainment without losing a bit of its frenetic energy."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"In between all the crash bang and wallop, there are also some truly odious villains, with Vader as sinister as he's ever been and Australia's Ben Mendelsohn clearly relishing his role as the human-cyborg's psychotic chief enforcer."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The movie works even if you only have a passing knowledge of the Star Wars universe or haven't seen the original in years. But there are several enjoyable callbacks and some eye-popping surprises for die-hard fans.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The Force is strong with this film -- a perfect fit as a prequel to A New Hope.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Even though the film is much grungier and more realistic than all the previous chapters, this corner of the ""Star Wars"" universe still is a thrilling place to visit."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The movie has a completely different, more sophisticated feel than most recent special effects-driven entries, including last year's so-so ""The Force Awakens."""
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's too grimy and relentlessly bleak to be any fun, and lacks the substance and drama to be taken seriously."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,It tries so hard to be an epic masterpiece - with self-important speeches and an insanely outsize orchestral score - that it ends up a laughable parody of itself.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the best Star Wars movie since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A solid film with its own vision and tone, yet undeniably still a part of that wonderful galaxy far, far away."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"If the franchise can continually pull off blockbusters with the same level of creative energy and the proper amount of reverence as Rogue One does, there's every reason to expect greatness for years to come."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"If only the two-hour plus runtime made time to dig into its heroes like the original trilogy or The Force Awakens did, Rogue One could have been as sensational and satisfying."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"For this lived-in universe, Rogue One features some distinctly CGI distractions: revisiting classic characters and resuscitating them 2016-style. It's crude and unnecessary in a film that's otherwise fairly sturdy, if unremarkable."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This is exactly what Edwards always said he was going to make - a STAR WARS war film. People die, and tears will be shed. Anyone who thought it would be watered-down should think again."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"""Rogue One"" stands on its own, an entry that is at once part of the ""Star Wars"" franchise (obviously) but also separate - a tougher, grittier film."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Almost pedantic in its inoffensiveness
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,All the pieces are there ... like Lego figures in a box. The problem is that the filmmakers haven't really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The action sequences, both on the ground and in space, are rousingly staged. But the losses incurred in those sequences are sobering. The stakes in the ""Star Wars"" rebellion are high indeed."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"When the universe ""expands"" in this way, it actually makes it seem so much smaller."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,It is a brave attempt at making a new kind of Star Wars movie but seems all too eager to express its fealty to the source material without thinking up any ideas of its own.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Intriguing and richly diverse characters, a suspenseful plot, an amusing sidekick, and a very satisfying answer to one of the most persistent questions from ""New Hope."""

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One isn't so much a movie as a feature-length promotional film for itself; it's a movie that is still waiting to be made.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One is a bold and stirring adventure film that will have both fans and casual observers spellbound.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It's constant blowing stuff up. Jyn Erso is STAR WARS ""Joan of Arc"" without a zealot's fervor or dynamic leadership presence. She is the only female fighter and all the nomad soldiers blindly follow her. What happened to Mendelsohn's face?"
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story does exactly what it is supposed to do by incrementally expanding the Star Wars universe that we already know.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Hard-core fans who thought Episode VII was a dumbed-down rehash will bask in an action-packed film that refuses to spoon-feed information. Mind you, that's the same reason why the casual fan will be disengaged."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we know by heart. When you think about it, that's pretty exciting. And it opens up a world of cinematic possibilities moving forward"
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Aside from [K-2SO's] killer lines, wonderfully voiced by the indispensable Alan Tudyk, most big satisfactions in this big, big movie come from references to Star Wars adventures you've loved before."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"It stands alone as the best Star Wars entry since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. Yes, it's that good."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Just once I'd like to see a Star Wars film and be wowed by seeing something completely new and fresh. I didn't hate it, however it commits the crime of being underwhelming and unoriginal."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is groundbreaking for the Star Wars franchise, a rousing side story that blows the doors wide open for future installments of the series. That it stands on its own as a slam-bam action thrill ride is a bonus."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"As pure retcon-meets-thought experiment, Rogue One scratches an itch that has been tickling since that initial screening in '77."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is worthy of standing alongside the original trilogy. Not only in terms of quality, but in creativity, imagination, and inspiration."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story answers the question of whether that galaxy far, far away is big enough to sustain multiple offshoots with an emphatic yes."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Contained yet expansive, nostalgic yet new, Rogue One introduces striking heroes and villains and fills its two hours and 13 minutes with a narrative that fits snugly into canon"
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One is a more-than-worthy prequel. Which is a first in the Star Wars universe
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is better than [the prequels] by a long shot, but after the high bar set by last year's Episode VII - The Force Awakens, simply being better than the prequels isn't good enough anymore."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The chaps are heroic. The villains are dastardly. All that's missing is Burton and ""Broadsword calling Danny Boy""."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The Force Awakens may have reanimated the once-dormant franchise, but it's Rogue One that will give Star Wars fans a new hope."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"K-2S0 contributes sorely needed humor, but nowhere near enough."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The good news is that Star Wars fans will never want again... but the movies themselves may have gotten a little less special as a result.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Despite its darker tone, Rogue One feels cosily at home in the Star Wars universe, and is crowded with the kind of imagination-tickling details the franchise thrives on."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One shouldn't work - from everything from the reshoots to just the fact Star Wars is breaking from centering its story around the Skywalkers - but, yet, it does work. Mostly."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Technically deft but emotionally cold.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Even an underwhelming Star Wars is a pretty decent Star Wars, but Rogue One misses a real chance to turn the familiar into something remarkable."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Star wars, indeed: The thrilling ""Rogue One"" brings a gritty combat-movie aesthetic to George Lucas's beloved space opera, but not at the expense of a thoughtful, emotional story about the foot soldiers who make sacrifices in the name of a movement."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A little bit ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" a little bit ""Dirty Dozen"" in its mass wartime slaughter, and a pretty good time once it gets going."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A more-than-worthy addition to the galaxy far far away.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,...doesn't move the bar on what it means to be a Star Wars movie in any significant way.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A much bolder addition to the franchise that makes risky deviations from the winning formula. That those bold decisions pay off is impressive, most ...well, you know the rest."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"For all its vivid visual imagination, the film left me almost totally cold. And I say that as a man who has cried actual tears at more than one Star Wars movie."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is a movie crammed with fan service, but when fan service is done this well, there's little to complain about and much to adore."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Very good, and often great... A true cockle-tickler for fans hoping to stoke the excitement of their inner nine-year-olds."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A movie that pushes boundaries and takes the kinds of risks this series needs to take in order to evolve to a point where it can tell completely new Star Wars stories featuring characters we've never seen before.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story upends Lucas' familiar saga by zeroing in on the compelling lives outside the orbit of the Skywalkers. There's one word that accurately conveys what this movie does to the Star Wars universe: Rebellion.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A swiftly paced, rough-and-ready entertainment that, in anticipating the canonical events of ""A New Hope,"" manages the tricky feat of seeming at once casually diverting and hugely consequential."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"The ultimate Star Wars fan film, it's short on whimsy but when it gets going there's enough risk-taking and spectacle to bode well for future standalones."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"In a series of by-the-bible films, this is the iconoclastic one. And that's its charm."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One manages to succeed as both super-nerdy fan service and the first entry since the 1977 original that will satisfy people who have never seen a Star Wars film.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,This story isn't going to be like any Star Wars movie you've ever seen.

Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One might trade heavily in nostalgia but it's bold enough to take risks, and will leave you stirred, fired up and raring for more."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Rogue One is a big, crazy video game movie -- but even big, crazy video game movies are allowed to say something."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This movie is about the journey, not the destination. And the journey is about as exciting as a long drive down the Florida Turnpike."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One is a return to form and the Star Wars movie fans have been waiting for since the '80s.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Despite a galaxy of potential and a number of killer moments, Gareth Edwards' Star Wars spinoff feels painfully forced."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"I'm recommending it, if only as a three-star action movie. But I think it's important to consider how the original Star Wars movies transcended their pulpy influences and how Rogue One gets mired in them."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"If nothing else, Gareth Edwards' combative, hard-working installment answers why the Death Star was so easy to destroy in the first place."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Its variations on a theme are muscular and adroit. This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,A punchy standalone action tale about a spunky Rebel Alliance resistance group.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This instalment isn't about looking backwards. In essence, it's a war movie and director Gareth Edwards keeps the momentum going with a string of stunning set pieces."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Still too reliant on nostalgic fan-service, but a clear step in the right direction for these newfangled 'Star Wars' movies."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The Force should have been stronger with this one.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,The Star Wars franchise has built up a massive amount of cachet over the last several decades; Rogue One is going to need every bit of it.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Yes, it's part of a series that is now eight movies strong, but it also works alone as a movie about war, oppression, a dangerous heist, a daring rebellion and a spark of hope that ignites the final stages of a revolution."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Loaded with more battle action than any of its seven predecessors, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story plays like a set-up for the events in the 1977 original and, for the most part, does so quite entertainingly."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One is less the fetish object that The Force Awakens is because it at least has the ambitions to create its own character dynamics and plot routes rather than coast on existing ones.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Will give die-hard Star Wars fans multiple orgasms...runneth over with Star Wars spectacle.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A thrilling, but flawed drama that considers the cost of fighting for one's beliefs."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,This is more like it...the 'Star Wars' movie J.J. Abrams SHOULD have made.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"This ""Star Wars"" spinoff doesn't spin very far off from the franchise, but it's a serviceable stopgap between chapters."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Seems to want nothing more than for the audience to pat itself on the back because they know what Yavin 4 is: It's a fun game to play at Comic-Con, but it doesn't make for much of a movie."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"Boasts thin characters played by great actors scampering about far too many planets with names that sound like obscure venereal diseases. It's a ""Star Wars"" knockoff that happens to look a lot like a ""Star Wars"" movie."
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One builds to one of the best third acts in the entire franchise.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,Rogue One makes up for a shaky first act by punching into overdrive for an outstanding third act battle sequence that overwhelms in scale and intensity.
Star Wars,ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY,"A darker, grittier Star Wars than we've seen before that suggests, as much as one can, what it was like to discover George Lucas' space opera in the first place."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"[The Last Jedi is] proof that well-made franchise stories... can deliver a new engrossing chapter that respects the much-loved past while slowly closing the lid on it, and steer the ship in exciting, mature ways that push the boundaries..."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi works. It's macro and micro stories entertain, either if you're predisposed to like what it has to offer, or at least not actively resistant to it."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"But on many levels, The Last Jedi is the antithesis of the virulent discourse it generates: a reminder that flaws can give way to strengths, that being willing to be wrong is a strength, and that doing the work, not getting the credit, is what matters."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Whereas the first half is a sort of a convoluted mess. ""The Last Jedi"" becomes a dark and exciting sequel that becomes the film you've been looking for by the 75-minute mark."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The success of The Last Jedi, like its father before it, will most likely rest on the conclusion of the trilogy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,It's the one we've been waiting for.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"It's a two-and-a-half hour movie. It needs to be good in its own right, not just setting up for the next episode. A two-and-a-half hour, $200 million set up?"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"If you're a fan, you're going to appreciate the story continuing (on and on). If you're into makeup and CGI, you'll appreciate every minute of it."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"It calls the very idea of solo heroism into question. There are plenty of daring heroics in The Last Jedi and no shortage of characters who want to step into Luke's or Han's shoes, but now that impulse is shown to just make things worse."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Along with non-stop action, there seems to be more wonder, whimsy and humor in The Last Jedi, some of it deliciously subtle."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"When it comes to pop cinema at this massive level, isn't it better for a movie to take Imperial-sized chances than just giving you what you want? I'll go with yes."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Johnson takes the narrative through its paces, weaving a complicated and fascinating story. Just when you think one thing is going to happen, the story shifts."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Thoughtfully humane and visually epic.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"A wonderfully directed, acted, and progressive film. Though it takes place in a galaxy far far away, the emotions and politics are very much here on earth today."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Whereas JJ Abrams's The Force Awakens delivered a nostalgic joy that focused on reigniting a legacy I grew to love and obsess over throughout the years, Rian Johnson instead creates a nostalgia towards my years of childhood imagination."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"With deep reverence for what has come before, Disney has proven that they aren't afraid to move the story forward."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The best ""Star Wars"" film since the original trilogy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"""Star Wars"" is not ""Breaking Bad,"" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"It is overall, a good movie worth watching. And timely, as our own modern-day First Order takes roots."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The Last Jedi speaks for the strength of a united front against imperial aggression...The final image leaves us with the assurance that young people tired of injustice will pick up the ball their elders dropped.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"On a second pass, the questionable was extremely overpowered by the bold and the courageous, and I saw Star Wars: The Last Jedi through a different prism. I connected with it differently."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi may not be perfect, but the need to accept imperfection and keep going becomes one of the movie's themes...It's about mentorship that's invigorating rather than smothering."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The great strength of the eighth part is also how it plays with the expectations of the audience
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"[Rian] Johnson fulfills the necessary action and emotion, but fails to make something intelligent. "
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Despite Disney's humorous sequences, [The Last Jedi] revives the good in the saga. "
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The highs definitely outweigh the lows, and The Last Jedi is in the upper tier of films set in that far, far away galaxy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The evolution of all the new characters was really good.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,It's a Force to be reckoned with.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Even if the stuffed-gills plot grew frustrating, I'm still looking forward to the next foray into a galaxy far, far away."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,There is just enough good material embedded in the excessive padding to appeal to our cravings for more Star Wars.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"When a character is in danger, you do feel that danger...there's something about the craftsmanship in this one. That feeling of security is gone, but the movie has a lot of humor too."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The new, machine-tooled The Last Jedi is sufficiently busy (action scenes occurring every ten minutes) to make you grateful that it is, at least, agreeably paced, even if it isn't really about anything."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"I both loved it and strongly disliked it at the same time. I feel like there's a really great movie in there, all the pieces are there, everything is brilliant, but then there's a lot of extra fat that needed to be trimmed off or rearranged."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"At two-and-a-half hours, with about nine separate cliffhanger endings, it's a bit long, but Johnson's keen visual sense, doses of humor and a couple of cameos buoy the film"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"There's a lot to like in the new Star Wars film...But it is not, as so many are saying, either the best Star Wars movie ever nor even the best since The Empire Strikes Back."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The music still feels fresh and Rian Johnson's film will please the fans with its wonderful visuals and abundance of action. But for me, there was something missing."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The story is compelling and there are some good characters to follow on this journey through many twists and turns. The acting is solid, and the visual effects are top notch. This is an impressive effort by writer-director Rian Johnson ('Looper')."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The mission is noble. The result, disastrous. "
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"A red throne room evokes the Technicolor fantasies of Michael Powell and Vincente Minnelli, while the scratchy surfaces of a sand planet trace the arc of each combatant's footwork like a choreographer's notation, transforming a duel into a dance."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"There is simply no joy in The Last Jedi. But all great legacies, I guess, are destined to fade."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,It's fun to look at.

Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"A stellar, if slightly overlong, followup to 2015's Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens..."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Daisy Ridley is always in motion. Her role of a young warrior is intense, but her moments with Adam Driver, comparing good and evil, are good, indeed."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The thing that makes the film most interesting is its function as a bridge between two paradigms, really two distinct generations, Boomers and Millennials."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Jedi offers a rather bold reinvention and expansion of what the Star Wars universe is capable of.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"That's when the film offers moments... that go from euphoria to sadness, from fear to uncertainty, and from incredulity to the unexpected; moments that will surely be established as some of the best in the entire franchise. "
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Considering that the franchise returns to Abrams in the next installment, surely the producers will ask for neatness and solemnity ... for old times sake"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,I wish it were a much better movie than this one. 
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Last Jedi has been favourably compared to The Empire Strikes Back and while there's some truth to that, they're very different films. Yes, it's dark but it's the moments of light that you'll remember."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"I know I'm in the minority here, but director Rian Johnson's follow-up to The Force Awakens felt overstuffed and incredibly disjointed; a collection of uncorrelated rah-rah scenes and little else."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Writer-director Rian Johnson repeatedly shows an inability to build to moments. His screenplay's biggest beats come off as self-defeating and lifeless.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"What's most interesting to me about The Last Jedi is Luke's return as the mentor rather than the student, grappling with his failure in this new role, and later aspiring to be the wise and patient teacher."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"They ticked off all the boxes except the one marked ""Jar Jar Binks."" You are very old if you needed to see all these characters again."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,A fantastic sequel...
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"With a script by director Johnson, ""The Last Jedi"" is a mash-up of many different stories, but all with the same main plot line; good versus evil."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"If you can accept the excess, the weird humour, the entirely inessential subplot, and the fact that it could stand to end a scene earlier, then the series will continue to thrive in a galaxy far, far away."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Where Abrams left us eager for more, Johnson leaves us sated and willing to wait a couple of years for the next episode. Still, there's plenty of fun to be had, and the series faithful won't be disappointed."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The Last Jedi tackles the bigger questions that the morally sure previous entries did not.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,It is the best and most innovative Star Wars film to come along in a long time and you would think that this would inspire celebration in the streets among longtime fans of the franchise.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Hamill and Fisher, who give ""The Last Jedi"" its emotional depth, are joined by Adam Driver, who once again shows himself to be one of the most skillful young actors of his generation."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"""The Last Jedi"" is not a crude predictable entry to the series; Rian Johnson has delivered a luminous spark that's left the future of the franchise looking bright."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,... the director manages to raise a moving monument to something as brilliant and even corny as the possibility of a shared dream.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Digressive rather than progressive, The Last Jedi fails to develop the new, exciting and complex characters we met in The Force Awakens."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Abrams gave us the gentle re-introduction we needed, and it paved the way for writer and director Rian Johnson to take the story in strange new directions."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Luke Skywalker rules all in this movie, but there's a lot of stuff that doesn't work."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Although not worse than the prequels for me, The Last Jedi is its own special kind of meh that demonstrates Disney doesn't have the guts to do this franchise any justice."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Over-funded, bloated, self-important and virtually immobile, The Last Jedi bears more than a passing resemblance to Jabba the Hutt."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"This movie feels like a TIE fighter on the fritz, spinning in circles as it fires off one light-show after another."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Here, [Mark] Hamill turns in his best performance, giving the character a depth and complexity that wasn't as evident in the original trilogy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"With Johnson at the helm, the torch-along with the lightsaber-is safely passed to a new generation"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,the most interesting people are no longer related to Darth Vader
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"While a good Star Wars film, this was not the best. With issues across the board (technical, character and plot), The Last Jedi does leave much to be desired."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Undoubtedly, Johnson is able to make some notable moments..."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,There's a sense of closure. Which makes The Last Jedi an incredibly cathartic experience.

Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Rian Johnson leavens political high seriousness and fan-service tear-jerking with enough charm and humour to prevent The Last Jedi becoming the biggest downer ever delivered at Christmas by the Walt Disney Company.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"More good things and fewer bad things happen in this movie than in any of the three prequels, but the film is hellbent on presenting its good things in the worst possible light."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"What The Last Jedi does so well over its two-hour, 32-minute thrill-ride is start to escape the gravitational pull of orbiting the same Skywalker family squabbles on the big screen for 40 years."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"With Star Wars: The Last Jedi, writer-director Rian Johnson takes the Star Wars saga into uncharted territory, with exciting results."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"In The Last Jedi, movie magic has been replaced by hocus pocus. Or perhaps even mumbo jumbo -- never has the eastern-western pop psychology of the franchise rung so hollow."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Last Jedi is good, in parts very good but not as good as The Force Awakens. It's too long but not tedious, it's often funny and full of action."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"From the seemingly infinite number of universes in which The Last Jedi was a bad film, or even just an OK one, Johnson has found his way to the one universe in which it is a good, occasionally first-rate one"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"For those of us who were there at the start, there's one thing that makes The Last Jedi unmissable: Carrie Fisher. Go and see it for her."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"This chapter relies so much on its call-backs and references that it all feels a little bit too safe. But still a damn fine movie, pushing the story forward in style."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The Last Jedi should be the last Jedi. My interest died along with Hans Solo who took with him that cowboys in space humor that made the franchise so special.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"As the third act approaches, the crescendo of air-punching interludes accelerates, eliciting gasps, cheers and OMG whoops from an audience whom Johnson treats with respect, affection, and evident admiration."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"It's a bold and challenging work -- exactly what we would expect from the auteur of Brick and Looper. In the debit column, it's also a tad bloated."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The Last Jedi brings to the audience something much more complicated for a movie to cause than tears: chills.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,What serves filmmaker Johnson well is his willingness to take more risks within classic elements than Abrams may have been able to. The real measure of the success of a film in a franchise of this stature is whether or not it ignites the imagination.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"While The Last Jedi may not receive top marks for originality, the eighth official entry in the Star Wars saga is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year..."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"This delightful if overlong film has so many arcs and subplots that you'll find yourself parsing them later... not because they don't work, but because the film packs so many scenes that reward closer-than-normal observation."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a spirited continuation - sometimes spectacular, often humorous - of the never-ending space saga."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"With The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson's done to the Star Wars franchise what Joss Whedon had done for Marvel with The Avengers. Disney and Lucasfilm have another solid franchise base in the offing now."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"These are small choices, but important ones. The kind that make us care. The kind that make us ask, Who hurt you? Kylo Ren may be a boy at heart, but he's a villain in full."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"With The Last Jedi, Johnson finds that sweet spot of reverentially seeing out the old to firmly make way for a new, perhaps final, space odyssey."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"A poignant farewell to Carrie Fisher. With dynamite women leading the action on all fronts, The Last Jedi is a fitting tribute to her legacy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Even if real fanboys are not pleased with some of the revelations (and, perhaps, not all should be believed), the major impact of The Force will go a long way in keeping everyone relatively happy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"When the salt settles, we are left with neither triumph nor tragedy; instead, it's one more chapter in the continuing saga, punctuated by a few moments of genuine awe."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The battle that inaugurates The Last Jedi is now and in the eyes of a lonely child, the ray of light in the sky that awakens his imagination. "
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Arguably the most beautifully directed film of the series so far. About as good as it gets for four-quadrant, tent-pole film-making. Wonderful."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Last Jedi is awe-inspiring and poignant. Expect to be riveted, despite its runtime of two-and-a-half hours."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an engaging mesh of new and old threads of past and present Star Wars narratives coming together to make a cohesive and exciting film."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,It's all watchable to those of us in the Skeptics Tribe. I tacked on an extra half star to the star rating for this solely because of my outsized affection for a glorious section in the middle that I enjoyed as I have few other Star Wars side journeys.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Sci-fi violence, strong female characters in thrilling epic."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,[Rian] Johnson's miscue has posed a disquieting question: Are these filmmakers authors or fans?
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a muddled movie that has some incredibly high points and beautiful scenes... [but] also contains a lot of distracting filler.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"It's a Rian Johnson film through and through, which is why it feels like a breath of fresh air. "
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"There are also quite a few new creatures, among them various icicle dogs, turtle-face monks, and some impossibly cute thingies called Porgs, which look as if they nest in gift shops at night."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"However, as much time and energy has been devoted to the goings on of Rey, Ren, and their various friends and enemies, try as the film might, it doesn't generate much in the way of genuine interest in these characters."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The film is a relentless crowd-pleaser that has as much in common with a pedigreed art film as it does a traditional action blowout.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The characters, like the movie, take what they need from the past, leave the rest behind, and forge ahead into unexpected and exciting new terrain."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a visual spectacle that expands our understanding of the Force and how it shapes a ""galaxy far, far away,"" adding to the mythology and lore of this franchise."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Just like The Empire Strikes Back set the benchmark for the ""orig trij"", The Last Jedi does the same for the sequel trilogy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Johnson - like George Lucas before him - has an eye for capturing epic moments that simultaneously feel effortless and throwaway.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"In short it is a dynamic, action-packed addition to the 40-year-old series that no self-respecting fan will want to miss."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Remixing the structure of the originals with the aesthetics of the prequels.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Rian Johnson's film is the real deal, a bold, risky venture unafraid to tell its own story, freed from the weight of nostalgia and formula."

Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The Last Jedi represents a triumph for the series and will make you forget Jar Jar Binks ever existed
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Johnson ends the film with the rebel forces on the defensive and with their resources mostly spent. Yet he offers a sliver of hope - there's that word again - as he assures us, when the screen fades to dark, that brighter days are ahead."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Demonstrates an understanding of the Star Wars universe and its appeal, while also taking it into wonderful new directions"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" reminds us all over again why this franchise is so beloved."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"I can say that the film is visually spectacular, with another superb soundtrack from John Williams, and mostly well cast."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Johnson is easily the most skilled filmmaker to helm one of these (it's not even close) and it's not just that the film has a surface beauty of its own. He's aware of what we expect narratively from a 'Star Wars' movie, and delights in subverting it."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,But the biggest thing this eighth chapter does is change where things go next in a fundamental way.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Armed with intelligent dialogue, fully dimensional characters, and the requisite wowie-zowie audio-visual effects, the Rian Johnson-Walt Disney Pictures-Lucasfilm-Ram Bergman Productions of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is pretty darned good."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Star Wars franchise is in good hands with writer-director Rian Johnson, who delivers an enthralling, often funny and at times achingly beautiful galactic adventure in The Last Jedi."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"By being easily the most unconventional film in the octet, The Last Jedi underscores exactly what Star Wars was always about. Hope. We need it now more than ever."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"It's easy to forget the original movie was a terrifically bold, innovative, industry-realigning blockbuster. Lucas dreamed big and took massive risks. In that sense, The Last Jedi could not be more different to the Star Wars created four decades ago."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Writer and director Rian Johnson will surprise you with new story possibilities, new emotions, new visuals to feast your eyes on."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"... plenty of twists, turns and pleasant surprises to hold an audience rapt over the two-and-a-half-hour running time."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back because it's so much more than stars and wars. It's those stories, joys, and pains of the heroes, villains, and nobodies who lived it."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"In practically every frame, writer-director Rian Johnson conveys how much fun it is to do this stuff."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"an entertaining, engaging ride, and it's all thanks to having a true filmmaker behind the lens"
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Rian Johnson understands how to balance the strengths of the franchise, which is simultaneously a fun action-comedy for kids, and a decades-long epic with meaty philosophical themes."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Whew! ... The Last Jedi thankfully returns to the tone of fun, adventure, and especially camaraderie that J.J. Abrams established so well in The Force Awakens."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"[Johnson] clearly knows the material well enough to give us exactly what we expect, and he loves it enough to take it into new territory."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Moving on from previous glories to start anew furnishes greater moments for the characters than the story, but it adds to a movie that's thoughtful, emotional and contemplative."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"If the previous entry presented a respectably staid melding of old and new, this one wires everything up, cranks the juice, and lets her rip."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"There is a thrilling space opera somewhere in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, if only it could rise above the echoes of its original mythology."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Epic, fun, visually sumptuous, it will tug at your heart strings because we come to know the characters across several episodes and we root for them when we recognise our own emotional responses in theirs."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Last Jedi is not a film for the faint of heart. But courage, a sense of wonder, a resounding faith in the strength of love, and a healthy dose of hope will take you far."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Rian Johnson's wildly fun and thoughtful entry into the Star Wars canon finds its heroes at a precarious turning point.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The movie's richness invites more than one viewing.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Last Jedi continues that transition in a way that will gratify those who were around for the beginning of the series. In other words, let the space exploration continue."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Certainly J.J. Abrams' 2015 ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was more than satisfying, but Johnson steps it up several notches, digging deeper into characters, and even adding nuance to the ""Star Wars"" mythos."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Even with the warts, Star Wars: The Last Jedi feels like a big, dazzling holiday present most Star Wars fans should be able to tear into and enjoy."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The Last Jedi is built on a series of oppositions relative to one of the best known films ever made. It's the prisoner of its middle chapter predecessor.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Last Jedi is a sample of what Disney intends to do with this franchise, turning it into a product full of cliches, empty plots, forgettable villains, [and] one-dimensional characters. "
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"In a world bursting with flashy popcorn movies, there's still nothing quite like a ""Star Wars"" flick."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The Last Jedi probably does the best job of any Star Wars film of capturing the allure of the Dark Side and the spiritual turmoil that would lead to-and also result from-its embrace.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Nothing less than the smartest, most nuanced, most ambitious Star Wars film ever made."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Sporadically thrilling, but overlong, exhausting, tonally uneven, and often dull."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Johnson works in the somewhat limited palette that is Star Wars, but this middle chapter in the new trilogy also starts to break out in ways that should excite fans at the prospect of what's to come."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"With the passage of time, The Last Jedi may rise again as a necessary film, essential between one and another of the saga."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,The forceful 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is a cinematic triumph.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Simply put, if you love or even just enjoy the ""SW"" universe and its various trappings, you're going to, at a minimum, find this one to your liking."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Nothing in ""The Last Jedi"" is allowed to be mundane, including the places the filmmakers take the story."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"But these are minor quibbles compared to the depth, wonder, and sense of heroism that The Last Jedi brings back."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"In the end, ""The Last Jedi"" delivers everything you would want from a ""Star Wars"" movie, something that's become both a blessing and a curse."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"There are twists you won't see coming and just when you think you've figured everything out, Rian Johnson pulls a rabbit out of his hat."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" could very well be the definite evolution of the series yet."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Rian Johnson, writer and director of this film, took my Star Wars reveries and served them back to me with vast improvements."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Has fresh story beats and new ideas ... Yet as the complicated, messy plot unfolds, the lack of a larger vision in this new trilogy becomes more glaring."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Rian Johnson's middle chapter in the current Star Wars trilogy is the epic you've been looking for. Capped by Mark Hamill in the performance of his career, it points the way ahead to a next generation of skywalkers - and, thrillingly, to a new hope."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The true star is Mark Hamill, giving the performance of his career as the anguished, isolated, tortured former Jedi Master. His scenes are worth the ticket price alone."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Muddled by bombast, but it finds significance in the art of failure as a means to an end for a new beginning (again) for Star Wars."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The dialogue is peppered with droll admissions and Star Wars-savvy sarcasm, which helps to prick the heroic sweep so common to these trilogies."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Where J.J. Abrams sought to give this new trilogy a firm but predictable foundation to build upon, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is a risk-taker. This is to be applauded absolutely."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Unjustifiably long and with misplaced humour throughout, The Last Jedi nonetheless delivers some scintillating action, spine-tingling lore and a loving farewell to Fisher."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Goes in bold new directions while delivering familiarity. Written and directed with thoughtfulness and visual flair.
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Movies should be better than those we could imagine up on our own. Rian Johnson knows what we want to see, and shows it to us in ways we couldn't have envisioned without him."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"By now, the franchise is mainly about giving the audience more of what it's already given it, and the gifted writer-director Rian Johnson (Looper) delivers just that..."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"...a great Star Wars film, one that honours the traditions of the franchise but boldly pushes the envelope in terms of thematic complexity and emotional tone..."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"The Last Jedi deserves nothing but acclaim, and Johnson, an incredibly adept director, deserves to be handed as many future Star Wars films as he can manage."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,Lucas Hit the Jackpot!
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"A reboot of Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is overlong, heavy-handed and fun if mostly uninspired."
Star Wars,STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI,"Older characters pass the baton to a new, female-centric generation led by the outstanding Daisy Ridley, the new face now a confident actress with great screen charisma"

Star Trek,STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE,"The rule with Star Trek films is even-numbered films are good, odd-numbered are bad -- and the first film in the series is no exception."

Star Trek,STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN,"It's not Shakespeare, but it's certainly fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN,"Star Trek II is a very satisfying space adventure, closer in spirit and format to the popular TV series than to its big-budget predecessor."

Star Trek,STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN,"If only director Nicholas Meyer had grasped the implications of his tale more fully and enthusiastically, this might have become a classic piece of cornball SF poetry, but as it stands the tepid acting and one-set claustrophobia take a heavy toll."

Star Trek,STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN,"Here comes a sequel that's worth its salt. The second Star Trek movie is swift, droll and adventurous, not to mention appealingly gadget-happy. It's everything the first one should have been and wasn't."

Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,Stirring but sad science-fiction enterprise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"These are classic directorial occasions, and Nimoy rises to them with fervor, in effect beaming his film up onto a higher pictorial plane than either of its predecessors."

Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"Not bad, but the series would boldly go to better places."
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,It's reasonably entertaining fare for non-fans.
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"This 1984 film's few and unimpressive special effects evidently qualify it as science fiction, but the genre it really belongs to is the male weepie: there hasn't been a gooier buddy romance on the screen since Joe Buck took Ratso Rizzo to Miami."
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,One of the best of the series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"It has the physique and will of a bold adventurer, but it's afflicted with acute brain-stem damage. Mixed in among some of Trekdom's best moments are some of the canon's sloppiest choices..."

Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"Decent SFX, but a little more action wouldn't have gone amiss."

Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"Something of a let-down, a longwinded paean to the grandeur of Leonard Nimoy's famous Vulcan character, which shouldn't come as much surprise since Nimoy himself directed it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"Directed by Leonard Nimoy, this episode could best be described as functional, in that the situation is interesting enough for a routine episode of the TV show."
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"Nimoy's first turn at the director's helm makes for reliable viewing, though no one will ever mistake it for one of the best."
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"The Enterprise crew blasts us with existential phaser hits, but this third series entry betrays its western roots so badly the spurs are showing. Glorious - if derivative - fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,The best odd-numbered Trek movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"All the old Enterprise personnel carry the film, as it is more concerned with character re-animation than development."

The last twenty minutes are equally slow, but the stuff in between is quite enjoyable."
Star Trek,STAR TREK III - THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,Familiarity breeds contempt since this is not really a notable entry in the Star Trek series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK IV - THE VOYAGE HOME,"If most movies today are doomed to be sure-fire, presold properties--with ideas leached from our recent TV or cinematic past--let's hope they're all as good at the game as ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home."""

Star Trek,STAR TREK IV - THE VOYAGE HOME,The best until First Contact...
Star Trek,STAR TREK IV - THE VOYAGE HOME,"The most successful and widely appealing of the Star Trek films, The Voyage Home is also the most idiosyncratic… some of the most humorous and humane moments in the Trek canon."
Star Trek,STAR TREK IV - THE VOYAGE HOME,"Mr. Nimoy directed this Star Trek installment, and indeed he should probably direct all of them. His technical expertise leaves much to be desired. But his sincerity is unmistakable, and it counts for a lot."
Star Trek,STAR TREK IV - THE VOYAGE HOME,"The Voyage Home isn't as dramatically powerful as the two previous Trek films, but it gives the characters plenty of time to show off their lighter sides."

Star Trek,STAR TREK IV - THE VOYAGE HOME,Immensely pleasurable.
Star Trek,STAR TREK IV - THE VOYAGE HOME,"A happy, heartfelt chapter that reunites the original cast with the original TV format, shying away from the cold and epic scale of the preceding movie adventures."

Star Trek,STAR TREK V - THE FINAL FRONTIER,Easily the weakest of the original cast Star Trek films.
Star Trek,STAR TREK V - THE FINAL FRONTIER,"Final Frontier is a warmly crafted picture only lacking a sophisticated technical and dramatic finesse the earlier features held in abundance. The film is never aggressively odious, just undernourished."

Star Trek,STAR TREK V - THE FINAL FRONTIER,It's amazing an entire studio would bend over to make William Shatner's ego trip.
Star Trek,STAR TREK V - THE FINAL FRONTIER,There is no doubt about it - Star Trek V is a bad movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK V - THE FINAL FRONTIER,"As 1979's The Motion Picture courted derision for its cerebral 2001 approach, The Final Frontier damages it's own cause with a high-brow 'Man's Search for God' story."
Star Trek,STAR TREK V - THE FINAL FRONTIER,"Bloated, bombastic and maddeningly pretentious."
Star Trek,STAR TREK V - THE FINAL FRONTIER,"The whole point of the movie has something to do with the search for God and Eden, but the theme is presented in the most mundane fashion imaginable."

Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,"A fun, exciting -- and dignified -- sign-off for Captain Kirk and crew."
Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,"For a movie that begins with such promise, The Undiscovered Country ends with a whimper."
Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,"If, indeed, Star Trek VI turns out to be the last of the series, it couldn't have made a more felicitous or more satisfying exit."
Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,Director/coscripter Nicholas Meyer moves this vehicle efficiently. He employs some tremendous visuals.
Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,[The movie] realises that its strength lies in our familiarity with the characters by now and exploits this cleverly -- particularly in scenes where the crew must unearth traitors in their midst almost like in a Agatha Christie detective story.
Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,One of the dullest films of the sextet thus far.
Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,"Rich, action-filled and loaded with familiar literary and political references, not to mention a number of savvy in-jokes, Star Trek VI is an utter delight that should more than please fans of the series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,"Like its even-numbered predecessors, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is fast-paced and entertaining."
Star Trek,STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY,"Not the best of the series, but it is entertaining"
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,The first big-screen adventure for the Star Trek: The Next Generation cast...
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"""Star Trek Generations"" never beams us down. It's good cornball mainstream sci-fi, as close to brand-name reliability as this genre gets."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,Too many senten-tious insights and lame jokes have been grafted on to the basic yarn.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Fans of the series will no doubt be happy to see Kirk again under any circumstances, and if you hunger for the ""Star Trek"" experience, this will keep you nicely occupied."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Star Trek at its geekiest, and cursory filmmaking at its blandest."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"From the opening shot of a champagne bottle floating in space to the pulsating ribbon of an engulfing Nexus, the film's images dazzled me."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,Doesn't work as a goodbye to Kirk or as a hello to Picard.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Star Trek: Generations suffers from the feeling that it is only a bigger budgeted episode of the television show, one that fails to use the full potential of the cinematic medium."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"The seventh Trek extravaganza emerges as a disappointment, slightly better than the inept Star Trek V but markedly inferior to Parts II and VI."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"I had hoped Generations would rescue Star Trek from its pervasive dullness, but somehow things have gotten even more boring"
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,a little stiff but still good
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Star Trek Generations has enough verve, imagination and familiarity to satisfy three decades' worth of Trekkers raised on several incarnations of the television skein."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,It's nice to see Kirk one last time.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,At least the special effects and outer space vistas are more handsome than usual.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,The series' dullest instalment.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"I could think of two dozen ""Next Generation"" episodes that are a lot better than this flick."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,Rewards long-time fans but contains basic flaws likely to trouble general audiences.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Devoted Trekkers will have to see it to keep abreast of the ships' logs, but Saturday night at the flicks fun-seekers are apt to concur this one only fires on stun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"This entry isn't particularly strong, but it isn't terribly weak, either -- it's probably the best of the ""odd number"" Trek movies ever made"
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Shatner is godly ( and he gets to say ""Dillweed""!), but he deserved a better sendoff from Star Trek than this."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,Disappointing big-screen debut for Picard's gang
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,Both a dismal farewell to the old crew and a dull introduction to the new.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,So so attempt to combine two generations of Star Trek crews.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Generations is predictably flabby and impenetrable in places, but it has enough pomp, spectacle and high-tech small talk to keep the franchise afloat."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"It would have, however, been nice if Generations would have gone beyond the scope of the television series to deliver something a bit more substantial."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"A successful entry in the series, and a darn good film on its own."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,A superb sci-fi morality play about the vibrancies of love and work.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,...tries too self consciously to connect the old crew to the newer one and never quite makes a smooth transition.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"The plot holes are obvious and disconcerting, the sub-plots feel tacked-on, and the characters are both thinly-drawn and badly-played."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Mostly, Generations spends its running length searching for, and never completely finding, its niche."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,Here is a movie so concerned with in-jokes and updates for Trekkers that it can barely tear itself away long enough to tell a story.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"The meeting of Patrick Stewart's Jean Luc Picard and William Shatner's James T. Kirk is worth the price of admission or video rental: it's the clash of the titans, Shakespeare meets the Sixties."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,A rich and absorbing saga.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,A flawed but funky adventure involving a time warp known as the Nexus.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,Even so-called trekkies had several bones to pick with the plot and characterisation of this movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"It's so messed up, confused, and cheap that even the sight of Picard and Kirk fighting together can't save it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,This one is fun for fans. And I guess I'm a fan.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,"Everything this picture does differently is a piece of a potentially exciting story, but there just isn't any glue to hold this model Enterprise together."
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,This film is a triumph of style over substance.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,This journey is one bumpy ride.
Star Trek,STAR TREK GENERATIONS,Uninspired.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"It's easily one of the best in the series -- the best, in fact, since Leonard Nimoy and the old Enterprise crew saved the whales in ""Star Trek IV."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Not just the best of the Next Generation movies, but one of the best of the entire franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"If the film itself is a little bit generic, more of a popcorn sci-fi action film than a faithful adaptation of the characters from the series, that's probably all to the good."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"In zooming out from Picard's glinty eyeball, this eighth feature film from the Trek factory displays a zippy new energy and a sleek, confident style fully independent of its predecessors."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"The problem with most of the Next Generation Star Trek movies is that they feel like extended episodes of the television show. First Contact is the one time that it really feels like they made a Movie, with a capital M."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,...a huge step beyond Generations.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"It does a good job of serving up elements that will please the fans of the show, but it does not quite stand on its own as a memorable motion picture event."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"First Contact is no grab bag of camp gewgaws; it stands proud and apart, accessible even to the Trek-deficient. This old Star, it seems, has a lot of life in it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Star Trek finally gets imaginative, exciting and - dare I say it? - kinky."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Action-packed yet intelligent, this takes the very best of the TV show and gives it epic grandeur."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"The elegance of the story is enhanced by the sure direction of Jonathan Frakes, who also plays Commander William Riker."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,The historic first Trek movie entirely divorced from the original cast is no blot on the franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,A smashingly exciting sci-fi adventure that ranks among the very best in the long-running Paramount franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,This makes little concession to non-initiates.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,Among the two or three best of the Star Trek films.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"It robustly apes James Cameron's Aliens, even down to the head villain, played with kinky boo-hiss relish by Alice Krige, who appears to be channeling equal parts Cameron's Alien Queen and Marlene Dietrich."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,This film is going to have lots of return viewers and will be one of the more successful of the franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,The best of the Next Generation entries.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Compared to episodes before and those that followed, this eighth installment of the unkillable series is surprisingly watchable."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"The series now lacks all of its original stars and much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be, something the noncultist is ever less likely to enjoy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,One of the better chapters in the long history of this prosperous franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"With its fascinating storyline and its adroit insights into human history, identity, and sexuality Star Trek: First Contact is a winner."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,Nothing like a good villain to energize the franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,The excitement comes from Frakes's direction.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"A nicely constructed science-fiction film, with a simple premise, a charismatic villain and a good back-story to enhance the action."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,First Contact is often great fun and is never less than watchable; it will positively delight legions of Trek fans.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,This is one of the best Star Treks ever.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Focusing more on action sequences than characterisation, the breakneck pace gives an unsatisfying result."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Blessed with clever plot devices and a villainous horde that makes the once-dread Klingons seem like a race of Barneys, First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style"
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,One of the best so far in what seems to be a never-ending science fiction saga.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Following in the wake of a trio of disappointing features, First Contact proves to be the most entertaining Star Trek in more than a decade."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Star Trek: First Contact is one of the best of the eight Star Trek films: Certainly the best in its technical credits, and among the best in the ingenuity of its plot."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,A thoroughly enjoyable visit with the crew of TV's Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,It will engage you.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"It's a great movie, and a great story."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"One of the better entries in the Trek movie series, thanks to the most memorable villains from the Next Generation television series: the Borg"
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"If you don't already know and enjoy Star Trek, this is nothing more than another passable science fiction film. If you are a fan of The Next Generation, then you'll enjoy this one."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,Enough classic moments to keep fans happy.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,First Contact manages to rev some additional life into the series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,It is enjoyable. It is a must-see for Star Trek fans. But it is not cohesive enough to be a good movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,A good popcorn movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,Even if you don't count yourself as trekkie you should see it.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"The first stretch and the home stretch are so filled with visual interest and, more importantly, with the patented Star Trek philosophical and humorous tidbits that fans will gladly suffer the dull Borg patch for the pleasure of the rest."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"The film feels soulless and hollow, despite best intentions to the contrary."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"Deftly combining parts of Alien, Moby Dick and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, First Contact starts quickly and doesn't let up."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"While First Contact espouses the usual lofty Trek ideals, it never forgets to factor in the fun. As the Borg likes to say, resistance is futile -- and also unnecessary."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,This is a film that all the millions of Star Trek fans will treasure as one of the best in the now eight-film history of this hopeful future myth.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,The most exciting entry in the Trek franchise since the The Wrath Of Khan.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"For non-Trekkers, this is a great, free-standing special-effects adventure with much more fleshy characters than your average sci-fi yarn. Definitely a good ride. But there are also plenty of nods to Star Trek aficionados."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"The franchise needs Patrick Stewart. Far and away the best actor ever to don a Starfleet uniform, Stewart is the standard bearer for a series which has the opportunity to thrive as long as stories can be built around Captain Jean-Luc Picard."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,It has the melodrama of other episodes of the films but fewer absurdities this time around.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT,"The story is typical sci-fi fantasy, but the conviction of the cast--most notably the always-phenomenal Stewart--makes you believe and care."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,The problem with Insurrection [isn't] that it's like a two-part episode. The problem is that it's like a one-part episode that was more than doubled in length without having nearly enough drama.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,Like a long episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Feels like an overly long, slightly dull episode from the series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"...the lightest and most traditional of the movies, for good or bad."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"It's like one of those not-quite-favorite episodes from the series that you might enjoy watching again if it happens to air during a marathon, but it comes nowhere near achieving the best that Star Trek can do..."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,It's back to boring basics for the Gene Roddenberry franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"The extravagant makeup and special effects are actually unobtrusive because they're demanded by the pleasantly formulaic story, whose conflicts--and broad, innocuous political allegory -- justify the heartwarming resolution."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"It's an interesting story, more accessible to non-Trekkers than previous entries."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,Strikes a deft balance of predictable heroics and quirky humor.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Genial, well-crafted tribute to the moral values Gene Roddenberry instilled in his sci-fi series, that suffers from a recurring flaw in the franchise, a lack of real threat and danger."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Despite the usual strained stabs at topical social significance, Frakes maintains a brisk pace, staging the battle scenes with panache and undercutting the absurd techno gibberish with crass but leavening humour."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,Most of the television episodes have been smarter.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"This is really just a pretty good episode of the series, which is not really a bad thing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Not one of the most successful of the ""Star Trek"" films, it's always nice to see the cast reunite."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,This is a good deal more than just another sci-fi movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"The plot feels like something dug out of an old pile of Next Generation scripts, with a fuzzy focus on the wonderment of newfound youth"
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,Nothing more than a glorified episode.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,There are some nice moments early on.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Stewart looks great as usual and is impeccable in his familiar role, but most of the other principals were seriously underused."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Fun for most folks, heaven for Trekkers."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"A respectable and enjoyable, though hardly ground-breaking, adventure."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,More of the the same-old -same-old.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"An admirable mix of ethics, drama, humor, and outer space dogfights."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,Insurrection doesn't quite gain the mantle of 'Worst Star Trek Film' from Star Trek V -- but it gets a little too close for comfort.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"This should be review enough for most Trekkers: It's the better of the odd-numbered movies, but it is definitely an odd-numbered movie."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"The latest and ninth installment in that line, Star Trek: Insurrection, lacks the adrenalized oomph of its predecessor, but no adventure of the Starship Enterprise is without its gee-whiz affability."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,One of the weaker entries in the series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,An appealing millennial throwback to the hippie dream that is part and parcel of Star Trek's utopian ethos.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"In two outings as director, Jonathan Frakes has proven that he understands what makes Star Trek work on the big screen."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"The story has enough plot switchbacks, space battles and gizmo wizardry to ensure that most viewers won't forget the film until at least the next morning."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,Inert and unconvincing.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Insurrection offers endless pleasure and inside jokes for the hardcore fans, but it's less urgent than First Contact, the dynamic last installment of the series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"An acceptable movie to Trek fans, if disappointing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,A pretty decent movie that even non-Trekkies would probably enjoy.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Lurches clumsily between drama, hammy comedy, and moral lecturing"
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Like all recipes with too much of this and too little of that, this movie isn't so much bad, as it's just weak in places."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,Doesn't exactly boldly go where no one has gone before.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,I saw more creativity and pizzazz in the two-minute Star Wars trailer than in the 103 minutes of Star Trek: Insurrection that followed.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Star Trek: Insurrection isn't painful to sit through, but it adds nothing to the Star Trek mythos, and overall is a complete waste of time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,High-minded and shallow.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"You don't need to be a Trekkie to enjoy the trip, as long as you're young enough at heart to enjoy adventure wherever you find it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"The quirkiest Trek yet, Insurrection is breezy, low- key and often humorous."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Taken as a whole the movie is fun even if it does contain several long, dull passages."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,A mediocre entry into the series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,The only thing I hate more than a bad movie is a movie I can't follow.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,The plot just leaves too many questions unanswered in the end.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"A muddled, gimpy mess, filled with the worst sort of Trek cliches and ill-timed humorous outbursts. On top of that, the film might as well have been edited by Mr. Scott in the midst of a Romulan ale bender."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"If Merchant-Ivory produced a 'Star Trek' film, this would be it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Insurrection isn't nearly as good as First Contact. But is a far cry from the first of the Next Generation movie adventure, Generations."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,a sad passing for a once-pioneering series
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Another extended episode played out with a decided lack of conviction, with nothing ever really at stake, and lazy humor that's aimed strictly at the disciples."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"What starts out as a stroll through an idyllic Whole Earth Catalog-style communal existence resolves into a tightly knit sci-fi action adventure, packed with the verities that generations of Trekkies admire and expect."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,You can only play a piano so many times before it finally goes out of tune.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"When Star Trek starts to resemble Battlestar Galactica and Babylon 5, something is amiss."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,The film lost points for executing the much-vaunted Riker manuever using a bad Microsoft force feedback joystick.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"An enjoyable movie, employing the basics that should endear it to most Trekkers."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"There are other good reasons to see this particular film, including some sharply-staged action sequences and plenty of belly laughs."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"Trekkers will eat that stuff up; others will be looking elsewhere for something engaging, which cannot be found in the by-the-numbers story or the incredibly boring villain."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"[Combines the] idealism, action-adventure, and the requisite special effects with some of the gentle humor and romance that characterized the original television series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"They probably should have completely thrown the script out. That way, they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness."
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,It just is not sufficiently involving.
Star Trek,STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,"The movie's single best feature is its villain Ru'afo, played with scornful malevolence by F. Murray Abraham; he can take his place alongside Alice Krige's Borg Queen in 'First Contact' and Ricardo Montalban's Khan as a memorably creepy nemesis."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Only the most die-hard Trekkies will like this one. The good news is the tagline for Star Trek: Nemesis -' ""A Generation's Final Journey Begins."" ... And ends?"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It's not bad, really. It is also the tenth Star Trek movie, which means an awful lot of celluloid featuring grown men wearing children's stretchy pyjamas and standing behind plasterboard consoles looking purposeful."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Feels, unmistakably, like Paramount and everybody involved was trying to get through it as fast as possible, dumping the series in an alley to let the rats gnaw at the body."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Lots of sci-fi action mixed in with messages about peace.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"...fun stuff, unoriginal or not."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,It's a shame The Next Generation crew went out on this flat note.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The geek exodus from Star Trek will continue with this middling movie, a cheapo space battle that has all the cool allure of a disco-dancing Dad."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Without an intriguing adversary for Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and crew, it's all for naught."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Even though the special effects are as well executed as ever, the story doesn't excite or even allow us to really believe the premise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Reasonably entertaining if utterly familiar.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"A thinly plotted, anonymously directed film."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Disappointing.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The outcome is as professionally crafted as ever, but the material feels learnt by rote."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Tinkers around with an intriguing premise but with little creative facility for dialogue or structure...[splits] the difference between fans and neophytes, impressing neither."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"If you're a fan you'll be satisfied, if not ecstatic, but it's doubtful that this movie will win any new converts."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,A movie that blandly goes where too many Star Trek pictures have gone before.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"'Nemesis'? Try 'NUMBesis,' and fight nodding off during the first half."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,... The science fiction franchise that has been an institution since ... the late 1960s may be starting to show its age
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"How much more of this can we take? Nemesis is a decent film, and Trek fans will love it. But enough is enough!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Nothing new.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It doesn't deliver anything new to the series, and even fans might find parts distinctly slow, but it finally hits most of the right buttons."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Well, there goes the theory about the even-numbered ones all being good."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,There is a point in Star Trek: Nemesis that I could not help but start to think of The Muppet Movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Somewhere towards the end of the movie, exhaustion set in."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection. Which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Boring, dark, gooey, with plenty of earnest, furrowed brows all around."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Directed Baird is a new to the series, and he has done a courageous job at sending this crew to their last voyage in space."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,We are strictly going through the motions here folks
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago . . .
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"If this is The Next Generation's final voyage, then it goes somewhat gently into that good night rather than raging against the dying of the light. Should a final adventure give them the justice they deserve? Like Picard, I say 'Make it so!'"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"For me, this flight aboard the Enterprise was a bit of a letdown."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It's been almost 10 years since ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" ended in 1994, but you'd never know it by watching the latest film in the science fiction franchise, ""Star Trek: Nemesis."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Hardy's pout and baldie glare are high-quality stage-trained British Hollywood fiendishness and, like the Borg Queen, he seems to have taken his fashion tips from Clive Barker's Cenobites."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"...the Federation should consider their legacy before embarking on another tired journey...Alas, it's time for the filmmakers to stay home and avoid the exhaustive trappings of being their own worse enemy...ah, in this case...nemesis!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless, why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once?"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Experimental science bumps up against science fiction as the controversy swirling around genetic cloning is magnified in outer space.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,... it may be time for Paramount to more on to other Star Trek movie ideas or just more on together... enjoy it for what it is: one more time to see a beloved crew defeat evil in space.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,This will test fan loyalty to destruction
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"While there's nothing to fault in the performances or even the storyline, it's forgettable the moment the credits roll."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,A sci-fi snoozer.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Sorry, Captain, our dilithium crystals are run down completely. The Star Trek franchise is dead in the water!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Feels like a cold old man going through the motions.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,'How many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive?'
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,A cheapo space battle that has all the cool allure of a disco-dancing Dad.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"This tenth feature is a big deal, indeed -- at least the third-best, and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up, Nicholas Meyer's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"35 years of saving the universe takes its toll on the imagination, and this film, unfortunately, is stuck paying the check."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"As lo-fi as the special effects are, the folks who cobbled Nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that George Lucas has long forgotten."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,It simply doesn't have the sharp inventiveness and insight we usually associate with the franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"definitely something different, even if it doesn't quite live up to the filmmakers' obviously grandiose ideas"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Sure, it's more of the same, but as the film proves, that's not always a bad thing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The dialogue is inane, the plot insipid, and with the exception of some nifty special effects at the very beginning, this has nothing whatsoever to recommend it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,It's not the groundbreaking movie it needed to be to infuse the series with renewed life.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Not only is it talky, but the talk is repetitious, incoherent, and spoken in a soft whisper, as if the actors feared disturbing the audience in its restful slumbers."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"If you're not a fan, what you're most likely to experience are chintzy costumes, cheesy makeup, cute jokes, pages of indigestible dialogue and tepid action scenes bolstered by a lot of shaking the camera to make it appear that the Enterprise is suffering"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"I am a Star Trek fan, it's an even-numbered film, and sadly, it blew. I am so sad."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Star Trek: Nemesis is flat and uneventful.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Everything here feels like a rehash of what this series has been doing since 1979. There's no ambition, no attempt to take the franchise in a new direction."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"John Logan clones Enterprise skipper Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), geek-relatable android Data (Brent Spiner), and -- less successfully -- 1982's Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,The Enterprise is losing speed.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Whatever the weaknesses, ""Nemesis"" deserves some credit for its universality. It can be enjoyed by anyone, whether the biggest ""Trek"" nerd, or a newcomer to the series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,A movie that blandly goes where too many Star Trek pictures have gone before.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"An obvious attempt to mix the high-drama of The Wrath of Khan with the mainstream appeal (read: box office) of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, and for the most part it succeeds."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Never escapes the franchise formula enough to make Warp Factor 9, and take flight as anything more than a superior two-part 'Next Generation' episode with improved effects."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"This felt like the end, but was neither the best nor worst note to end on."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"John Logan's script hasn't enough invention or suspense even for an hour-long episode of the series, Stuart Baird's direction is leaden, and the look of the film is murky and dismal."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It's doubtful that Nemesis will please everyone -- particularly the hardcore fans -- but for casual Trek viewers, this is a pretty good ride."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It's all very convoluted this time out, and awfully silly to boot."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The action sequences in the film work well enough, but the film drags for about half an hour in the first half with an overlong expository interlude."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Star Trek: Nemesis stands alone as an engaging intergalactic thriller with a lot of spirit-and some rousing action scenes.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,The old crew is around and good to see.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,The ease that the Next Generation actors slip into their roles gives Nemesis a comfort zone that overcomes creaky dialogue and that fact that the biggest moments have been seen in earlier Trek movies.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Boasts explosive action and a decent story, but a slow start and a badly botched ending keep it from being remarkable."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"[Reaches] depths of laughable awfulness that can be appreciated, for their veritable badness as well as their campiness, only by True Fans."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Like going out with old school buddies: at first, you're thrilled to be with old friends again, but before too long, you realize that there just isn't anything new."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Clear proof that the series has long since surpassed its days of glory.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of God in the fifth Trek flick.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"This is supposedly, 'a generation's final journey'; too bad it didn't slow down enough to prevent it from feeling more like a generation eagerly racing to the finish line."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The latest adventure of ""The Next Generation"" crew is a rip-roaring space opera that, while containing some grand set pieces, is a bit uneven, failing to realize its full potential."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It almost plays like Solaris, but with guns and jokes."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"This is the fourth film to feature the Next Generation crew, and everyone is still off-track after the ideologically unsound, sparsely entertaining Insurrection."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,The worst voyage of the good ship Enterprise since they made the mistake of letting William Shatner direct Star Trek V.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"This isn't the worst way to be put to pasture, but the crew may want to hang on for one more episode if they can."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Should be the final nail in the coffin of this franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,The cheesiness so endemic to the Star Trek franchise ... is back in full force.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,An ordeal for all save the most ardent Treksters.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"As spent screen series go, Star Trek: Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Stewart instead lends integrity and wry stoicism to Nemesis, but the movie is unworthy of him."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Better than the tepid Star Trek: Insurrection; falls short of First Contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off Borg Queen Alice Krige's cape; and finishes half a parsec (a nose) ahead of Generations.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Long-time Star Trek fans -- who continue to live long and prosper -- will certainly enjoy Star Trek: Nemesis, but I doubt the film will win new fans to the long-running franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"While the movie itself wanders off-course halfway through, the coming attractions -- showcasing Nemesis' jacked-up special effects, production values and camerawork -- were a knockout."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Surprisingly, considering that Baird is a former film editor, the movie is rather choppy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Even though it doesn't feel like an appropriate send-off, the lethargy of Star Trek: Nemesis is probably indication enough that the series should end here."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Devotees of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu, and the grandeur of the best Next Generation episodes is lacking."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Taken as a tool to help retain public awareness for the various Star Trek books, video games, toys, and TV shows, Nemesis does its job relatively well."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"If this is indeed the swan song for the Next Generation gang, the end can't come soon enough."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series: Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it, and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"This voyage is more than competent, but it doesn't really go anywhere new or exciting."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It can't decide whether to appeal to hardcore Trekkers or to a general audience. In the end, it's not enough of one or the other to please either."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Star Trek: Nemesis spins a fascinating and, finally, quite moving variation on an old saw: You're your own worst enemy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"This isn't just a bad Trek movie, it's also bad science-fiction, riddled with psychobabble, inconsistencies and the hoariest of cliches."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection, several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Star Trek was kind of terrific once, but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Combines elements of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and James Bond flicks with generically satisfying results."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Those who buy into the peculiar superstition that only the even-numbered Star Trek movies are any good will find their belief system strongly challenged by Star Trek: Nemesis.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Baird has cooked up something that looks a lot like mom's casserole: Warm and familiar, but the same old thing we had last week."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,A plodding if mildly entertaining sci-fi adventure that plays more like an extended television episode than a full-length film.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Too much of Nemesis has a tired, talky feel."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Convincing evidence that the venerable franchise needs to be mothballed in space dock and not come out for another mission without a major refitting.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,The inside humor offers more than a few clever laughs as the confident crew radiates the good time that they're having.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,May satisfy the faithful but can leave the casual moviegoer feeling as if he's walked into a bar where nobody knows his name.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Familiarity breeds content with Star Trek fans, and the 10th movie in the series does nothing to mess with the series' comfortably monotonous fantasy formula."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,This one has some throwback qualities.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,The brand new take on the Enterprise's endeavors here is satisfying and appreciated.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Star Trek fans like their philosophy deep, and Nemesis, the 10th big-screen episode, does not disappoint."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"If you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before, but several movies have - take heart. This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Individual episodes of the Next Generation TV series were always clever at addressing social issues, even if they were cloaked in the hardware of futurism. Yet the movies have routinely devolved into one-dimensional battles of good vs. evil."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"After nine movies and countless television episodes, all of this just seems too familiar."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone who doesn't consider themselves a 'Trekkie'.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The values that have held the Enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage, self-sacrifice and patience under pressure"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The posters suggest that this is ""A Generation's Final Journey."" That may be the best thing about Star Trek: Nemesis."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Spectacle and special effects have saved equally bad movies in the past, but never one so hackneyed there's virtually no surprise or suspense."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,What nudges the movie toward a qualified recommendation is the continuing high standards set by Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The folks on the Starship Enterprise are never stodgier than when they try to 'loosen up' and play it for laughs, as they do often in Nemesis."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Star Trek: Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before. Wince-inducing dialogue, thrift-shop costumes, prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The torpid first half nearly made me drift into suspended animation. But the exciting second half makes up for it with a long, thrilling, Pyrrhic battle."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Nemesis has a delightfully nasty villain and pumped-up action, albeit along familiar lines."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"While fans might enjoy it or parts thereof, there's just not enough fun, energy or originality to entertain the average viewer."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Won't go into the captain's log as the U.S.S. Enterprise's finest hour -- that honor still belongs to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan -- but it is reasonably entertaining and reassuring, like a trip home during the holidays."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Though hardly a ridiculous mess like The Final Frontier, the 10th Trek outing, Nemesis, is as mediocre as the last franchise effort, Insurrection, with little appeal for anyone beyond patient, die-hard fans."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Not a bad premise, but the execution is lackluster at best."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"An amiably klutzy affair whose warm, fuzzy heart emits intermittent bleats from the sleeve of its gleaming spacesuit."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It is far from the worst, thanks to the topical issues it raises, the performances of Stewart and Hardy, and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,A strong enough effort to be worthy of faint praise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Familiarity and continuity are what the success of this series has always been about. We've been here before, and we like the neighborhood."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"I'll hate to see these old fogeys go, of course, but the time may have come to once again pass the torch."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Nemesis never feels true to itself, its energy never fully engaged."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Between its brisk start and explosive finish, Nemesis dawdles in talky, jargon-filled explanations."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Star Trek Nemesis is a definite improvement on 1998's Star Trek: Insurrection.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Choppy editing and a plodding, formulaic storyline confirm that the Next Generation production team did its best work in the TV series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,Perhaps Nemesis is the best we could hope for from a tired franchise
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,A better movie than the vacuous Insurrection.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy, but there's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can, given the embarrassing script and weak direction."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Better than Generations and Insurrection, but not as good as First Contact."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"At this point, looking to juice the series with action scenes is the equivalent of applying a defibrillator to a cadaver."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,It has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,The film's dark and gritty style gives this trek a real depth and human element most of the other films have lacked
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"...grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized, out of character and logically porous action set pieces."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"A tired, derivative picture that suggests it's time to put at least this crew of Trekkers into well-deserved retirement."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Could it be true? After so many years of bloodshed and war, can peace between the Federation and the Romulans actually be at hand?"
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"Good, old-fashioned idiocy, ripped from yesterday's headlines."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,A school-teacher's dream as Patrick Stewart tells his nemesis that the principal goal of every human being should be to become a better person.
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"A respectable venture on its own terms, lacking the broader vision that has seen certain Trek films ... cross over to a more mainstream audience."
Star Trek,STAR TREK - NEMESIS,"It's good to have the Next Generation crew back in action, and Patrick Stewart is still a commanding presence as Capt. Picard of the USS Enterprise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,For the most part this film was a successful retelling of a beloved story.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,J.J. Abrams dares to rewrite Trek lore with an origin story that chronicles the first voyage of the Enterprise crew with a mission that sends them into a whole new Federation history.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Aside from the cool effects and surprise cameos from notable actor/director Tyler Perry and one of the U.S.S. Enterprise's original passengers Leonard Nimoy, there really wasn't much there."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"J.J. Abrams' restart of the famous saga is a slick, well-produced piece of entertainment that blows the cobwebs off the venerable series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This is not your father's Star Trek (for better or for worse).
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Requiring little or no foreknowledge of Klingons and Romulans, this ""Star Trek"" is a grand equalizer, transporting everyone to a space where it's possible to just sit back and marvel at the starlit view seen from the Captain's chair."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek has remarkable freshness and originality for something so deeply familiar. And it leaves us confidant that a venerable piece of pop culture is in good hands, at least for the time being."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek keeps you occupied with the usual sort of thing you find in science-fiction adventures, done somewhat more wittily."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A rather lazily imagined, though energetically executed pastiche of big screen sci-fi clichés seemingly appropriated at random from other films."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Whether watching Kirk and Sulu skydive from space, a rural Mid-West dotted with vast interstellar towers, or Kirk do battle with a very ill-tempered beastie on a frozen moon, it's hard not to gape in wonder."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"I didn't go to this with much enthusiasm but, of course, it's been completely reinvented by J.J. Abrams and he's done a terrific job."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek works by paying homage to the past without being chained down by its history.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"As far as performance goes, Pine and Karl Urban -- Kirk and Bones, respectively -- do offer up moments of tongue-in-cheek allusion, but they sell it straight-up, and save the movie from becoming a list of inside jokes."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The film is sufficiently smart and engaging that Abrams has effectively guaranteed the characters will be back for further adventures.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,J.J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot beams a fresh set of dilithium crystals into a science-fiction film franchise that has been eking by on cinematic life support since 1991's The Undiscovered Country.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This is a fantastic movie. It's pacing is rapid-fire, the action is larger-than-life and raises blood pressure with ease, and the characters come to life in a very cool way."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek is back. It's action-packed, exciting, and visually spectacular -- who would have thought that the dying sci-fi series could be resurrected into something this fun?"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek is such a well-written, superbly acted and amazingly staged film that it sets a new standard for summer action films."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Some will walk away convinced they have seen the best Star Trek movie of them all. I can only agree wholeheartedly.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"With this new, dynamic duo in place, the possibilities for exploring the fabled final frontier seem endless"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"I'm no Trekkie, I don't speak Klingon, I've never boldly been anywhere in the least bit exciting -- my fear of motorways has always hampered me horribly in this respect -- and I don't like action epics but [Star Trek] is quite fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,J.J. Abrams brings the beloved but undeniably creaky franchise back to square one while still delivering a thoroughly contemporary science fiction adventure rooted in the spirit of Gene Roddenberry's original conception.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this rollicking movie. J.J. Abrams' reboot of the 1966 TV space adventure series is fast-paced, action-packed and lots of fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,There is still life and romance in these movies.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"In short, it'll please everyone, while never being as bland as that might sound."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,I think JJ Abrams and his movie 'gets' what Trek is supposed to be about.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A Star is reborn as director J.J. Abrams' re imagining of Star Trek emerges, against the odds, as a smart space epic that can be embraced even by wary Trek devotees."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams also avoids the pitfalls of the three Star Wars prequels, by making it a thrill to meet these familiar characters before they became the stars of the stars."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek director J.J. Abrams proves to be just what the franchise needed a jolt of life from someone unencumbered by the baggage that comes with more than 40 years of lore and legacy.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Abrams' movie inspires me to boldly go where I never thought I would: back for seconds.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"There's much wit here, bang-up action scenes and a twisting plot that will make sense to those who truly care to follow it. May this latest incarnation of the series live long and prosper."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This version is new and fresh, but it doesn't forget its roots -- and I think fans will appreciate that."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams had a responsibility that most other action film directors never need to worry about. He succeeds in parts, maybe enough for the young, modern audiences for whom the film has been made, but old Trekkies may have some issues."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,If you're a self-confessed Trekkie as I am you can't help but compare this cast to the original cast. I was surprised how easily I accepted Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban seems to channel Deforest Kelly at times.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"With the help of his young and pretty cast, Abrams has managed to successfully reboot a 43-year-old formula."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"For the first time in all my encounters with the Enterprise and the Federation, I actually cared about several of those important figures seated at the ship controls."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A manically paced, profoundly affectionate and highly entertaining prequel to a cultural touchstone."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Did somebody just reach through the space-time continuum and pull out a white rabbit?
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Fun, funny, exhilarating, and occasionally touching, Star Trek gives Gene Roddenberry's enduring sci-fi series a much-needed shot in the arm."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,A work of considerable technical expertise and workmanlike efficiency: It's uncanny how it hits every little pop culture note anyone could possibly expect from it.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Abrams brings a fresh perspective that strips the series to its essential elements while still paying homage to what made the original special in the first place.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The character work is consistently ace, but Star Trek 2009 doesn't offer the high-minded, underlying ideas that the show was known for."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,... it pleases me to report that the new film from Director J.J. Abrams pulled me (a Trek newbie) in like a Romulan tractor beam.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"We were very, very happy with what we saw. You will be too."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Just when you thought that the Star Trek phenomenon had truly run its course, along comes J. J. Abrams's stunning prequel to resuscitate the most enduring franchise in sci-fi history."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Salutes the rich history of the franchise while avoiding any hint of hokey, by-the-book starch."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,One of the most accessible and entertaining films of the year.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Get ready for a new influx of fans, Trekkers."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek has needed this kind of face lift for years.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek is a welcome return to the flippant, big-budget bonanza that exists purely for the spectacle"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A franchise is reborn, at warp speed."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Well, it looks like the curse is broken."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Although given the Starship Enterprise's keys, geek-culture maven J.J. Abrams warps the vessel like he stole it in a sleek, stylish reboot stuffed with jailbreak momentum, deft pacing, dense plotting, passionate principles and perfect casting."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"J.J. Abram's Star Trek is a refreshingly entertaining space adventurer, reinvigorating a well worn out franchise while paying homage to past labours."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Not content to just make this the Spock and Kirk show, with supporting players largely reduced to broad strokes, Abrams makes it clear that he's interested in Star Trek as an ongoing, fully fleshed-out ensemble piece."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Somehow J.J. Abrams has managed to make Star Trek cool again, with a fresh and fast-paced, action-packed thrill ride that both new and old fans can lavishly enjoy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Thanks for the memories; let's leave it at that
Star Trek,STAR TREK,One could melt into the luxury of the experience Mr. Abrams provides and objectively appreciate every penny spent in the budget as there is not a false or cheesy speck to be found on screen.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A mindless, milling mess. Just what you would expect from somebody schooled in the Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer academy of bad directing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This Star Trek will be exploring the cinematic universe for many years to come.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"...the film will go down, and endearingly so, as the Brokeback Mountain of space operas... In all the cosmos, a fatherless human and a motherless Vulcan find in one another that which they had lost."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams manages quite well in making $150 million look like an episode of Babylon 5. Fistfights are poorly edited, and when he wants to create excitement and tension, Abrams simply has the camera shake around a lot in close-up."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Yeah, there's a plot, too, but it's almost completely overshadowed by the introduction of the new characters."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Standing in contrast to the angst-ridden, lumbering and dark vibe favored by so many action flicks, it has plenty for fans and almost as much for those who couldn't tell a tribble from a tricorder."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"An incredibly satisfying popcorn picture, Star Trek hurtles forward with propulsive energy"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,It's heartening to see the wit and romance of the series treated lovingly
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The 11th feature in the long-running series is not just a great Star Trek movie -- it's a great movie period.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"For most people, this is a popcorn flick and, as such, everything just sings. Sings a new variation of a highly recognizable and pleasant melody."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek knocked me over the moon.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"One of the best sci-fi films of the last decade, and that's coming from someone who has never Trekked before."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Six-and-a-half years after Hollywood left the Enterprise crew for dead, ... Kirk is back, baby, and he's better than ever."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,J.J. Abrams proves his masterpiece can translate into great work on the big screen that all Trekkies will love.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"[It] broadens the appeal of its cult property, turning what was once strictly nerd fodder into a shaggy dog action movie."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Destined to become a sci-fi classic, ""Star Trek"" boldly goes where none of the previous entries have gone before."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,the excellent action sequences plus an upbeat tone--an important element maintained from the source material- make for an adventure that zips by at warp speed.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Normally, eleven versions equate disaster, but somehow, someway, director J.J. Abrams and the creators of Star Trek managed to pull off the best sci-fi movie since The Matrix."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"While entertaining as a space soap opera, the film dismantles much of what made Star Trek once great."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Ingenious backdating and character establishing in what everyone but the creative team thought was an exhausted payload."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Director J J Abrams has made summer 2009 an event.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Abrams doesn't get the franchise that Roddenberry created.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"By Kevin Irwin - Star Trek, the final frontier in nostalgia, a crass ploy for box office kerching or a celebration of sci-fi's most iconic forefather? Well, a touch of all three as it turns out."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This is arguably the best of the Star Trek movies.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Well-cast and well-acted...however, (the script) falls short of engaging viewers as intellectually or emotionally as the best prior movies and TV episodes have done."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The film is a success because of beautiful visuals, swift storytelling that never loses its momentum, and the sheer joy of having these characters back in our lives again."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"... Youthful, fast-paced, thrilling, funny and fueled by an adventurous spirit."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The movie, typically for Abrams, is almost continuously exciting."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Well, at least they got it half right."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,a skilfully constructed studio picture that boasts a casting coup on par with The Lord of the Rings'.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A bold, entertaining reboot."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"In Abrams' capable hands, the film is hugely satisfying. Smart, jaunty and savvy, it takes Orci and Kurtzman's script and races with it, boldly opening a new chapter in the series while giving it a fresh shot of life in the process."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Clever, campy, even a little endearing, Trek revives itself by going back to the past, but consumes itself by wanting the ""Trek"" of future, too. In the current remake craze, it's never enough."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Mixing warp speed action with tongue in cheek humor, this Trek beams brighter than a supernova."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Beam me up, Scotty, this Trek rocks."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Here is a film that slaps your expectations around with surprise after surprise, leaving you shaking your head in disbelief that a Star Trek film could be this good."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The movie begins with a bang and it's one of the loudest SF movies ever made.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It has some significant flaws and missteps, but on its own merits, it's entertaining -- and in one instance, it's even a little more than that."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A genuinely entertaining thrill-a-minute sci-fi romp, whether you loved the series or not."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"In making yet another Star Trek, the great challenge the filmmakers... faced was to be contemporary while also respecting the past. Star Trek passes its obstacles with dazzling, time-warping colors."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"By resurrecting Kirk, JJ Abrams has not only revived and revitalised Star Trek, he's given it a dose of Viagra."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A fiery dynamo. Big action, snappy direction, good acting, respect for the past. This is the summer blockbuster to see."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,...immediately establishes itself as a contemporary reboot done right...
Star Trek,STAR TREK,... has a lot of humor but is very serious about its premise ... about as good as Hollywood blockbusters get.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams and his collaborators don't kowtow to the past. They exhilarate, engross and amuse viewers by putting entertainment value above all else."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Set phasers for fun. May this Trek live long and prosper.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,successfully crafts a new beginning that both honors the series' previous incarnations but also charts its own course using a clever time-traveling narrative that essentially creates an alternate Trek universe
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A new fan of the series--and there are more that I would have expected--can enjoy STAR TREK, but a veteran ""Trek"" devotee will get a lot more out of it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams' whole approach to this revamped Star Trek: Be playful, be unpredictable, and full speed ahead."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's been thirty years since I last found myself at the movies, rooting for a black hole."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It is a hi-energy, optimistic work, but it gives the impression of being afraid to alienate its audience with too much nerdy information."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This movie wins. It manages to have reverence for its source material but also uses it as a jumping off point to make a 21st Century version of the franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Lost and found planet mayhem in this reconceived excursion down intergalactic memory lane, as cocky spaced out Kirk locks horns with Bana's sulking skinhead in an unresolved cosmic anger management funk."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A splendid space saga so spellbinding, I won't complain about their resurrecting that infuriating, infinitive-splitting catchphrase, 'To boldly go where no one has gone before!'"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"...a full-blooded and busy adventure, a promising restart."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Is the new Star Trek movie perfect? Absolutely not. But I went in an original Trek fan ... and came out feeling oddly elated, grateful for the things that worked and secure in the belief that the rough spots will work themselves out in the a"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Full of excitement, adventure and just plain fun. Everything old is new again!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Great characters, nice comic touches, but the plot cries out for an intervention."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Somehow pulling off the trick of appealing to the wider mass audience with one foot in Star WARS, the most startling thing about this new TREK is how it avoids being AWFUL."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Barely competent. J.J. Abrams has a TV soul.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"What Christopher Nolan did for the Batman franchise, J.J. Abrams has done for Star Trek."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,I must add that the reason I think this new Star Trek works has less to do with Abrams being the director and more to do with a genuinely smart script by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"With great effects, a strong story and equally strong cast, ""Star Trek"" is a journey worth taking..."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This Star Trek essentially turns out to be a war film, with the occasional philosophical timeout to discuss love, friendship, and duty until the next bone-crunching fistfight or multi-weapon rumble with the Romulans."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This is the best Star Trek movie, ever. Better, even, than the classic Start Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,[Director J.J.] Abrams kicks his film into warp drive and boldly goes where the Star Trek actually has gone before. Only better.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Good mix of special effects, an involving story, a good script, and fine ensemble acting."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"With director J.J. Abrams on board, the newest movie in the series is not only action-packed but also filled with surprises."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Yes, the genie is back out of the bottle. Well acted, expertly edited, and brilliantly watchable even if not perfect. And above all, it doesn't suck."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The unpredictability of this alternate reality gives future screenwriters a free hand to go where no one has gone before.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,a Luddite picture wary of the future and reliant on something so simple as being human to be the salvation of the human race.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's disheartening that Deforest Kelly, James Doohan, and series creator Gene Roddenberry won't be able to see their legacy ""beam"" back to life and continue at warp speed."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A gigantic bore for more than half its running time, but it eventually grows surprisingly involving, thanks mostly to its great cast."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Sacrilege alert! It may even be better than The Dark Knight.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,J.J. Abrams muscles aside Trek's ponderous aspects with a rip-roaring storyline and enough action to qualify as a galactic James Bond movie
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Trek fan or not, only a person who hates action movies entirely could hate Star Trek."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"...Elicits laughs, adventure, and refreshing, positive energy in a way series creator Gene Roddenberry intended."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The first Star Trek movie that feels fully realized. It's smart enough to be accessible to everyone, while retaining enough respect for the franchise's legacy to please diehard fans."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Faced with the task of acclimating new audiences to this venerably corny space opera, J.J. Abrams simultaneously executes a franchise reboot and nostalgia play."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek might annoy purists, but everyone else will be glad to see Spock and co. again."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Fun, but like most of the previous movies, it doesn't approach the quality of the best episodes of the original 'Star Trek' or 'Star Trek: The Next Generation.'"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The young cast is mostly callow and TV-bland and the special effects don't quite seem worth that hefty price tag, but overall this is a presentable addition to the franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"J.J. Abrams has done the impossible: not only resurrected the 'Star Trek' franchise, a concept built on space-age idealism, but also re-imagined it for cynical 21st century moviegoers."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Possibly the best modernization of the series I could have imagined... Abrams manages to walk a thin line between pandering to the fans and reaching a new, modern audience."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"We didn't exactly need another Star Trek but it finds the perfect blend of action, drama and nostalgic comedy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"What I do have a problem with is sacrificing plot for speed, for thinking that grand spectacle and a great sense of pop culture are all that you need to make a new journey with the crew of the Enterprise work."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Don't be surprised if you feel just like me when you leave the theater. I was ready and eager to see my newfound friends in their next space adventure.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A new Star Trek film so full of life, wit, smarts, thrills and sheer gratifying entertainment that it launches the mind on a stream of merry somersaults."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams' Star Trek strikes a beautiful balance, with enough allusions to Trek mythology to please longtime fans and enough 21st century verve to wow even those viewers who know nothing of Star Trek."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"With Star Trek Abrams honors the show's legacy without fossilizing its best qualities. Instead, he's whisked it off to a planet where numbing nostalgia can't kill it, and where the future is still something to look forward to."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The wit and youthful energy that's been infused into the new Star Trek should enable this venerable franchise to live longer and prosper more handsomely.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"In going back to tell the Enterprise story from the beginning, Star Trek presses collective emotional buttons people didn't even know they had. At its best, the effect is like seeing life panoramically, past and future, simultaneous and magnificent."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Just because a film is noisy, colorful and fast does not ipso facto mean that it is also a rollicking entertainment."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek goes back to the legend's roots with a boldness that brings a fatigued franchise back to life.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams has approached the source material with the right spirit of loving irreverence, and set the stage for what hopefully will be a rebirth of an enduring franchise. A five-year mission doesn't feel nearly long enough."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"You needn't know the secret handshakes or utter the Vulcan blessing ""live long and prosper"" to gain admission to, and enjoy, summer's first thrill ride."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Trust me when I say Star Trek is easily one of the best science fiction films of this decade
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The time-travel plotline not only fuels this exciting movie, but jump-starts the old franchise into new directions. ... It allows this Enterprise crew to boldly go where not even Star Trek has gone before."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The greatest prequel ever told.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"In his daft, dizzy reinvention of a moribund franchise, Abrams has found a way to be referential without being reverential, to conjure nostalgia without being constrained by it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The movie has an easy-going, unlabored charm. Unlike the dreadful latter-day ""Star Wars"" pictures, this one honors the unflagging devotion of millions of fans."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This isn't just the most playful, surprising action movie in years. It's also the funniest. They're not going where no man has gone before. But the way they go there ... wow."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"With a warp-speed 'Wow!', Abrams&Co. has taken a spent franchise and, unlike a heavy-handed plastic surgeon, has reinvigorated it without destroying the original look. Leonard Nimoy might want to see what they can do for him."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,It's this Star Trek's greatest stroke of genius to conceive of Kirk and Spock as two rebels looking for a cause...
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The overall impression is one of unbridled enthusiasm on the part of the film's makers, both for its predecessors and for the brave new universe Abrams and his crew are exploring."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Should please a wide cross-section of viewers.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Not Trek? The movie has gaping plotholes, a skirt-chasing Kirk, time travel, and a BS pseudo-scientific resolution to a life-threatening situation...it's totally Trek!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's Star Trek, Jim, but not as we have known it. A masterclass in how to rebrand and relaunch a franchise. Sign us up for more alien girls, punch-ups, phasers, photons and misbehaving black holes."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,J. J. Abrams's thriller Star Trek is the first tent-pole film that has made me sob with pure pleasure.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Fast-moving, funny, exciting warp-speed entertainment and, heaven help me, even quite moving - the kind of film that shows that, like it or not, commercial cinema can still deliver a sledgehammer punch. It sure didn't feel like a trek to me."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek is a truly good, dare I say great movie. But I don't think it has a lot of re-watchabilty and not in the league of The Dark Knight""."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Don't worry this time around, our pop culture is in good hands."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This is a grand success - perhaps a new populist benchmark in what to do with a flagging franchise, and a witty, light-on-its-feet prequel which makes instant toast of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. May it live long and prosper, by which we mean, sequels, soon"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek used to be smarter. But it was never this fast, fresh and exciting."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Funny, moving and fine escapist entertainment, the magnificent Star Trek is cranked up to Warp Factor 11 by the cast and crew. May the franchise live long and prosper under the guidance of J.J. Abrams."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek is fresh, funny, exciting and - biggest surprise of all - emotionally engaging."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This is impressive stuff. Abrams moves the plot at breathtaking speed, yet still has time to feature heroic acts from all the original show's key players."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A revamp everyone can get on board with, from die-hards to those who wouldn't be seen dead at a sci-fi convention. Buoyant, buffed and with the promise of even better to come, this is the freshest Trek in decades."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek bristles with energy and excitement, and you can practically sense the enthusiasm with which this film has been approached by everyone involved"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This is such a rollicking adventure, it's truly enjoyable."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek is the first great blockbuster of the year and is undoubtedly a bona fide masterpiece in the family genre.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This is everything a summer blockbuster should be. Star Trek is a film that will delight fans and impress people who have usually steered clear of the franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,It must rank as the outstanding prequel of all time.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Overall, it makes for an entertaining, if uneven, couple of hours, although non-Trekkies may not find it the intergalactic go-see they'd hoped for."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek pulsates with adventure and thrills, infectious with its boyish enthusiasm to entertain and respectful enough to pay tribute to the cult series that came before it. See it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams has achieved what previous Star Trek directors and George Lucas's prequels failed to create - a gripping, action-packed, humorous slice of escapism."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek comes out with its high beams on, its pacing hyper, and its phasers set to ""stoked."" And it never hits the brakes."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,But idolaters need fear no iconoclasm and newcomers no exclusion. The start of a presumably new chapter in the franchise is marked by affectionate respect tempered with an eye for modern visual tastes.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"There will be plenty of takers for this Enterprise, I think, but they shouldn't count on seeing much that's new in the course of it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek is everything that fans could have hoped for. It throbs with a dynamism that we haven't seen in the series for a very long time and creates a slice of expertly crafted science-fiction escapism.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,...captures the spirit of the original series and makes watching these characters fun again.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Given Bana's baddie is about as threatening as a scatter cushion and the plot is arm-chewingly repetitive, what will appeal most to bemused non-fans is that while the Star Wars prequels disappeared up their own mythologies, Star Trek is a right giggle."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"You do get a sense, despite all the other attempts to re-do Star Trek, that this lot boldly go where no man has gone before, and that Abrams has reinvented the series without murdering everything that has gone before."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"If you realise that it has one aim - to introduce an entirely new audience to the franchise - and go into the cinema knowing that, then you'll have a good time. Unlike like me: I sat there with my arms folded, tutting a lot."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Hugely enjoyable, wonderfully cast and genuinely thrilling blockbuster that, incredibly, gets everything right and will please both die-hard Trekkies and newcomers alike."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Fully inhabits the Trek universe while pushing well-known characters into all-new directions
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek is the most enjoyable, spectacular, smart and yet brilliantly simple summer movie for an absolute age."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Set your phasers to stunning because Star Trek is every bit as thrilling as the hype would have you believe.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Re-injecting a sense of fun and escapist wonderment into science-fiction films (and blockbusters in general), it's a supremely well-made picture that understands the value of a sense of humour and knows how to ratchet up the intensity."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's like what Alan Moore said about Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns: 'Everything is exactly the same, except for the fact that it's all completely different.'"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Hell, you could know nothing about the words ""Star Trek"" and still find a lot to enjoy here"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Boldly go and revel in the awesomeness and nostalgia this action-packed prequel will elicit.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Here is the highest compliment Abrams and company could have hoped for: They leave Star Trek better than they found it.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"What Abrams ... has done is pay tribute to the legacy of ""Star Trek,"" while taking it in a direction that will surely re-energize and resurrect a moribund property"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Spectacularly entertaining -- fast-paced, glib, thrilling, and slickly produced. It's better than most summertime action romps even bother trying to be."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"All in all, the material is strong enough and exciting enough that not even Abrams' fumbling can entirely ruin it, and it's certainly better than the last two series entries."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This is a different Star Trek. It's hipper. It's hotter. It's going to be the biggest movie of the summer, and no corny little one-liners will do it justice."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"For those who want a thrilling ride, Star Trek should do the trick. It has just enough old-school stuff to keep longtime fans intrigued, even if a bit disappointed."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Fascinating.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,A meticulously calibrated blending of old and new.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Director J.J. Abrams reaches for the stars...and mostly succeeds in getting there
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"While it might be a little long and while Spock is disappointing, this is still an entertaining movie with fine performances by Pine, Pegg, Greenwood, and Urban."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The battle sequences in the first seven or so minutes of opening sequence, with Kirk's mother laboring to bring him into the world while his father fights to buy enough time to save everyone, are worth the price of admission alone."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Highly illogical but entertaining as hell.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"I loved the second and fourth Trek films, but this cosmically entertaining movie is the best the franchise has ever produced. Can't wait to see what Abrams does next with his new crew."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This is premier summer entertainment.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The result is not a great film, but it is great fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Bravely vindicates its source material's essential underpinnings of friendship and honor. 'Get a life?' This is the redemption Trekkies have been living for.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,J.J. Abrams has raised the craft of rejuvenating a movie franchise to something like a fine art.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek does a remarkable job hitting all the right notes with die-hard Trekkies and engaging those who've never heard of a tribble. The bar for summer 2009 blockbusters is set very high.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Let's hope hardcore Trekkers can suck it up and embrace this new vision, because there's no doubt everyone else will."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This Trek is an exciting, constantly entertaining feature that helps kick off this year's summer movie season in spectacular fantasy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Everything from the score, the slow motion effects to Abrams' ability to instantly draw you into this new universe quickly sets the tone for an engaging two-hour thrill ride."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Exciting, captivating and thrilling with eye-popping special effects. It's an exhilarating rush of adrenaline that will please Star Trek fans old and new."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"I can name exactly three and a half things ""Star Trek"" gets wrong -- and I can name about a thousand that Abrams and his cast and crew get absolutely, pitch-perfect, elegantly right."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's the kind of franchise opener that leaves you giddy for a sequel, stuffed with ideas about where to go from here. It's the kind of blockbuster that makes you happy movies exist."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams found the perfect, and perfectly science-fictional way, to do a reboot that no one can honestly bitch about, the perfect way to have his geek and his 'Bite me,' too."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Quinto is the one person here who may leave teen-aged viewers more perplexed than puffed up; he somehow rebukes the movie's whole obsession with backstory and immaturity by seeming riper and wiser than the charmless folly that is spun around him.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It is pleasant to report that though it's not perfect, the reconstituted Star Trek is successful enough for everyone to breathe a sigh of relief."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The new Star Trek arouses an instant affection that sometimes rises to ecstasy and never entirely wears out.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,It boldly goes somewhere different and makes it hard to leave the film not hoping for a return voyage soon.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"And just think, they haven't gotten to the Klingons yet..."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The effects, direction and film score were so beautiful and mind blowing that it made a grown man cry. That grown man would be me."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Is this where the future of Trek lies, in exciting action scenes and fun comic relief supporting underwhelming stories and stale ideas?"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Even by the standards of its own predecessors, this Trek feels like it was made by a committee of logic-minded Vulcans (or franchise-protective studio executives) rather than a filmmaker with the singular personality of Nicholas Meyer."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"With one film, J.J. Abrams has made Star Trek younger, flashier, sexier, funnier, and less intelligent, but more exhilarating than it has been in decades."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,JJ Abrams is a miracle worker. He has taken a script that is so bad and so dumb as to be almost a disaster and made a movie that's a lot of fun and actually quite good from it.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A bright, shiny blast from a newly imagined past."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The aim here is to court a new generation of fans without alienating the true believers speaking Klingon in the box-office lines.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Take note, George Lucas: This is how it's done."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This is really the story of how the Enterprise crew meets, hammers out its differences and becomes a team, and the telling is pure bliss."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,There are many satisfyingly sly flourishes in Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman's script.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"You couldn't ask for a less ponderous, more rollicking time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams' cannily constructed prequel respects (for the most part) the rules of that world and, more importantly, retains the original Star Trek's spirit of optimism, curiosity, and humor."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This non-Trekkie thinks you'd have to look back almost as far as Raiders of the Lost Ark to find an adventure this consistently, thrillingly, joyfully fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Phasers set on ""stunning."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"When it comes to sheer spectacle, Star Trek, as re-imagined by J.J. Abrams, delivers."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A movie that, against all odds, has miraculously resurrected a wheezing but beloved franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Under the swoons of the orchestral dirge, you can hear J.J. Abrams stride onto the deck of the Enterprise and shout, ""Welcome to my galaxy!"""
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This, indeed, may not be your father's Star Trek, but I hope it won't kill the buzz if he likes it anyway."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The film is just another noisy space opera in which the humanity takes a back seat to the hardware, something that the real ""Star Trek"" managed to avoid at its peak moments."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Abrams' redo isn't just a blast from the past. It's a blast.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's also a pleasure to report that, not only have Gene Roddenberry's ideas stood up pretty well over the decades, so have Spock's ears."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A film that should appeal to longtime Trekkies, sci-fi neophytes and pretty much anybody who likes a good action flick."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek is a raft, a map and a reinvented story with a great deal of spunk"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,An enjoyably mindless thrill ride.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The summer movie season has barely begun, but already one thing is certain: It will have at least one indisputably great movie."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"An immensely satisfying origin story that, narratively, goes all the way back to James Tiberius Kirk's corn-fed and hotheaded Iowa youth before introducing, one by one, the characters we know -- before we knew them."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Abrams and crew have gone where no man has gone before: boldly creating a crowd friendly sensation that, even in this market of a-blockbuster-a-week, should live long enough and boy, will it prosper."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"In order to become a new Star Trek, facets of its old personality must inevitably be sacrificed, while modern flavor -- faster pace and a little sass -- is infused."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Perfectly paced, wonderfully cast, cleverly written, and masterfully designed -- summer movies don't get much better than Star Trek."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The new Star Trek motion picture seeks to extend a lucrative brand with a young demographic. But it's a real movie -- breathlessly paced bordering on manic, but propulsively entertaining."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The much-anticipated movie reintroduces all the characters from the franchise's first iteration, but its most intense and rewarding focus is friendship between Kirk and Spock."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"For nearly its first hour, I felt I was witnessing Abrams hitting every beat just right, only to see him and his writers spend the final hour getting just about everything wrong."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"...not only a fantastic summer tentpole film, it just happens to be better than each and every one of the most recent Best Picture Oscar nominees."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,I loved it so much I wanted to Vulcan mind meld with it.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It aspires to be everything to everyone and it's as good as can be expected given those directives, but its prime directive is simple: have fun. It does and I did."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Unless you live in the weeds like me, obsessing over minutia that others never even see, Star Trek is going to be a jaw-dropping experience. The rest of us will just have to get over ourselves."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The story is constructed so we don't need to know what has come before. At the same time, the filmmakers don't want to alienate the long-termers, so they had to add something new to the canon of Trek lore."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Pulsates with a life and fire that the former series entries never quite equaled. So much is going on in each frame that one sits smiling for the duration, drinking in the images while yearning for a repeat viewing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"...even if you've NEVER seen ""Star Trek"" you'll be hooked"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"J.J. Abrams boldly takes the ""Trek"" franchise where it hasn't gone in a long time: to box office gold."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"An epic adventure that deftly captures the spirit of the original series, while succeeding utterly in charting a new course."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Sunny hothead cadet meets his Vulcan soulmate. Wisely, no bloated, buffoon pitchman has a cameo. J.J. Abrams put the budget on the screen."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's an exciting, stellar-yet-earthy blast that successfully blends the hip and the classic."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"With a crew like this, you can welcome the future."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The happy result is action-friendly, nerd-friendly, and fundamentally optimistic."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The Gene Roddenberry years, when stories might play with questions of science, ideals or philosophy, have been replaced by stories reduced to loud and colorful action."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Amazing sound, a ton of fury, signifying nothing... So densely orchestrated that the film never gives the audience a moment to breath it all in."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Fans will be thrilled, though not nearly as much as Paramount Pictures shareholders."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,As rousing as a Klingon war chant and more fun than an engine room full of tribbles.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Trek almost never stops being good, kinetic fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman manage to morph the new actors into the general outlines of the original crew, but even as they slip into the old character molds, they immediately start to break out of them."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The other summer tent poles have to stretch mighty high to reach the benchmark set by this soaring and explosive blockbuster. The action never tires in the amped-up Star Trek.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Somehow this movie manages the delicate balancing act of incorporating both the humor and action of the original series, while simultaneously satiating hard-core geeks and fans who thought the original crew could never be succeeded."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"That jolt of energy may resuscitate the franchise; its breathing, however, feels shallow."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"For the first time in 15 years, Star Trek actually matters."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Summer officially hits warp speed.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Smart, epic and eye-popping."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Star Trek is the perfect summer movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The naturalistic asides slung among our heroes are more than compensatory, establishing both a believable, well-oiled discipline and a collegial camaraderie."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,It took decades of increasingly mediocre TV series and Data-dull movies to beat Star Trek to death. But J.J. Abrams brings it all back to basics.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A new creation, one that serves as a self-contained film and a launching pad for a continuation of the franchise, one that should live long and prosper."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"This Star Trek sells cuteness, sentimentality and explosive F/X as if Starship Troopers, Minority Report, Mission to Mars or even Blade Runner or The Matrix (all visionary standard-setters) never happened."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Yes, it's a popcorn flick--and a first-rate one at that--but it also grants these figures a freshness they haven't possessed in a long time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Outrageously, unbelievably entertaining, and the most fun anyone has had at a movie in a long, long time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The final frontier of space is once again the place to be.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A fast-paced, witty prequel, a top-flight modern adventure...that's not only an affectionate tribute to the original but a successful rebooting of the whole franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"As unlikely as it once seemed, it looks like the ol' Enterprise has a few more light-years left in it after all."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"While hard core Trekkies may have some problems with it, this long time classic Star Trek fan found this reboot fun, fresh & exciting."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A largely thrilling surprise, its blend of humor, romance and action so kinetically orchestrated that calling out its shortcomings feels like excessive carping."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,It's not perfect but it is great fun ... It's hard to imagine anyone resisting this new cast.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek should quench all your Trekker geek desires, but make no mistake, this is still very much the same Star Trek, just with a younger cast and a lot more money thrown at it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This brilliant reninvention of the beloved sci-fi franchise boldly (and smartly) goes where no 'Star Trek' has ever gone before.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"More than any Trek project in decades, this one conjures the camaraderie, the easy humor and most important the swagger we associate with headstrong Jim Kirk and his logical, pointy-eared pal."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,It's enough to move even a Star Wars fan to tears.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Thankfully, both diehard and casual observers of Gene Roddenberry's original 60's televised blueprint will be zapped with stimulating giddiness more effectively than an errant phaser gun gone wild."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's exciting, moving, hilarious, action-packed, sexy and suspenseful -- in short, exactly what big, fun summer popcorn movies are supposed to be and yet so rarely are."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A near-perfect template for what a summer thrill ride should be, Star Trek is great fun that doesn't forget its brain, heart or sense of humor."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Either you'll go with it or you won't. Regardless, based on Abrams' ambition and scope in rejuvenating the franchise, it's clear it still has plenty of room to live long and prosper."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The four-decade-old sci-fi franchise boldly goes back onto the big screen as a muscular, action-packed summer blockbuster."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,The setup is complete; now it's time to see whether the implied potential of this first entry into a new series can be realized in its sequel.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Star Trek is destined to be remembered as one of 2009's biggest and best surprises, a gamble that beat both the house and those holding the cards to turn everyone into a winner."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A sublime space adventure that flies as confidently and triumphantly as Trek ever has before. It's not only a victorious series highlight, but perhaps one of the best pictures of the year...120 minutes of unrelenting goose bumps."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This is a totally character driven film with five exceptionally-cast people.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,I think JJ Abrams walks the line gracefully between honoring the original series and introducing the pop culture movie masses to these characters.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"If you care about this universe (and I do, damn it), you won't sit passively through J.J. Abrams's restart Trek. You'll marvel at the smarts and wince at the senselessness. You'll nitpick it to death and thrill to it anyway."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It is fun, exciting and exuberantly entertaining."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The average Star Trek fan is fatter than a Mugatu. And I mean the kind of Mugatu that just ate a family of Mugatus. Hey, fella, is that your mouth or the Doomsday Machine?"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,...director J.J. Abrams successfully establishes a new beginning for the Star Trek franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,You can feel the legacy in every scene. It just rocks.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,There is a good blend of character development and action in Star Trek which is why it will resonate so well with audiences.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,This is Star Trek designed for people who don't actually like Star Trek . . .
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A new mission worth taking, a spirited, energetic new beginning to a series long assumed dead."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,It's guaranteed to start a box office stampede.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Blasting onto the screen at warp speed and remaining there for two hours, the new and improved Star Trek will transport fans to sci-fi nirvana."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,JJ Abrams injects a gigantic dose of energy into this long-running franchise and brings it roaring back to life.
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Paced at warp speed with spectacular action sequences rendered brilliantly and with a cast so expert that all the familiar characters are instantly identifiable, the film gives Paramount Pictures a new lease of life on its franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Whether you have seen every Star Trek episode and film, or none at all, you should get out and see this, because it isn't just a great Star Trek movie: it's a great movie full stop."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Revitalizing the stagnant franchise, the gifted, visionary Abrams has performed a magical act, a movie that stands on its own merits and will recruit new fans, a work that will please the old trekkies and one that points to potent direction in the future."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"J.J. Abrams gives Kirk and Spock a new lease of life, but the plot is a mess."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"Reintroduces critical elements the franchise has not seen in years - cultural relevance, suspense, and a fresh sense of wonder"
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"It's been a long time since the hope and optimism of Gene Roddenberry's vision have seemed this bright, this alive. This is exactly the Star Trek movie this fading franchise needed."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The most exhilarating Trek to date marks a new future for Kirk and co. If this can boldly go on to seek out ideas to match its speed and style, a franchise is reborn."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"The result is a triumph, certain to be regarded as not just one Trek's better moments, but one of the finest films made in the sci-fi genre."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,"A stupendous production, Star Trek goes where no movie sequel or prequel has gone before in bringing intelligence and invention to a peak in cinematic storytelling."
Star Trek,STAR TREK,Script: tick. Casting: tick. Direction: tick. Special effects: tick. It's an extraordinary achievement and great entertainment for all as we partake in an edge-of-seat thrill-ride.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,There's a mundane theme running under the adventures of alien exploration and a villain who will not be named: styles of contemporary office management.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,This is a film that's simultaneously trying too hard and aiming too low.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,This movie is action PACKED.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness finally gives the talented Cumberbatch the chance to show Hollywood what he can do on the big screen, and, boy, does he seize it with both hands."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Darkness never really works as anything because it doesn't have any purpose.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Pulling off the trick of being both irreverent and Trekkie-pleasing, JJ Abrams effortlessly orchestrates massive action set pieces, a galaxy of 'cor look at that' CGI effects and well-modulated character scenes."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Even with his superior technology and an established commitment to innovative storytelling, Abrams might have been overly ambitious when deciding to halfway alter a classic."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a high octane but messily plotted romp, with solid performances papering over plot holes you could pilot a galaxy-class starship through."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The socio-political commentary of 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is about as sophisticated as you'd expect from scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtman, who also wrote the first two 'Transformers' movies."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The film is pretty spectacular, with enthralling action sequences and stellar special effects (when you can make them out through director J.J. Abrams' omnipresent lens flares)."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A well-made, somewhat serious-minded adventure flick is a rare thing, even one that does not seem quite as deliciously new as J.J. Abrams's 2009 reinvention -- which is merely to say that it is not my new favourite popcorn flick of all time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"At the core of Abrams' brilliant rebranding, beyond the astute and well-measured use of high-powered special FX, is the inspired casting of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as the younger Kirk and Spock."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,An exhilarating and often moving addition to the franchise.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Its greatest embarrassment is in trying to steal classic Star Trek moments without having a clue as to why those moments had meaning.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Whilst it arguably lacks the fresh energy of the first outing, Abrams here seems content to make minor tweaks to a winning formula, all the while keeping his sci-fi space opera accessible to all."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Into Darkness is an enjoyably solid effort, but it suffers from a lack of the innovation and inspiration of its predecessor (or indeed of Abrams's best work on TV)."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Apart from the grand set designs, which are stunning and seen through the blue hue of lens flare, the characters are the strongest asset here and are brought to life by the stellar cast."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The film will grab you from the opening shot and not let go.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,What Abrams has given us is the gravy without the meat and potatoes.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Ultimately, ""Into Darkness"" is prophetic and profound, vying for a place in the sci-fi Hall of Fame that houses ""Blade Runner"" and, well, the original ""Star Trek."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The geeky, bookish old days of Trekkies deciphering every single clue and riddle may remain, but the new Star Trek is more interested in spectacle and digital pageantry, and no one could deny that that is Abrams' strength."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,It's an agreeable ride and the fact that it treads so little new ground doesn't much detract from its pleasures.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek has always worn its sins on its sleeve, and it's no different here, delivering pure, self-aware escapism."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The poor movie. It just wears itself right out.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"This sorry sequel feels rote and hopelessly derivative, timidly going where we all have already gone before."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,J.J. Abrams once again successfully creates a fast-paced summer adventure that audiences should love.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The 9/11-style attack on London at the film's beginning is followed by backstory upon cover story and bright rhetoric soars and false flags are planted. They darkly wave. Political opportunity is not wasted on ready opportunists.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Star Trek Into Darkness still manages to be an even more enjoyable film than its precursor.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"In terms of sheer spectacle, there's no denying that it delivers. For all the build-up, hype, and hope leading up to the film, it's just a shame there isn't a whole lot more."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The effects are exhilarating, even in these jaded post-3D days, and there are enough action set-pieces, humour and character development to distract from a plot that isn't exactly sci-fi's final frontier."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"J.J. Abrams' Star Trek Into Darkness is a bigger and much louder sequel, which sacrifices brains and character building for expensive spectacle."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Cumberbatch, with his otherworldly aura of menace and basso profundo rumble of voice, makes a worthy and memorable Big Bad in the annals of Trek lore."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It's generally a lot of fun, but it's exhausting, and the busyness only somewhat disguises the fact that the story doesn't entirely make sense."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Suggests someone painting by numbers with Herculian intensity, and the effect is hollow and dispassionate."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Not as audacious or exciting as its predecessor but this sequel is still a fun summer ride.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,...a terminally perfunctory followup that just barely gets the job done...
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Far from going where no one has gone before, this Star Trek is only interested in retreating along its old tracks."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Either reinvent or stick to the source material, don't try to have your fun both ways. It doesn't work."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,... a summer film that dimly reminds viewers of what it used to be - and could be again - while still being little more than a rollercoaster ride.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,There's really very little to complain about in this warp-speed sequel.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,so enjoyable that it becomes easy to forget that virtually everything in the film is a riff or spin on something we (including only casual Star Trek fans) have already seen
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Thrilling if not exactly groundbreaking fun...yet something is missing this time around.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Moment to moment, it's as entertaining, rousing and visually impressive as any recent science-fiction action epic, but the script is cratered with illogical motivations and plot holes large enough to swallow Classic Trek's Doomsday Machine."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Even old-school Trekkers will enjoy this voyage.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"J.J. Abrams' sequel is smart, fun, witty, essential sci-fi."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It feels a little ""been there, done that"" but it still entertains."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,'Star Trek' safely does its job and is easily the first must-see action flick of the year.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Maintaining its reverence for the source material while employing an exuberant and clever script with one heck of a plot twist, Star Trek: Into Darkness is great fun and a more than worthy successor to the excellent first film."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Set phasers for fun with this blockbuster.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Sets its phasers on fun
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,One of the attributes this sequel to the prequel has going for it is a villain whose threat to mankind requires no prosthetics and/or makeup to freeze you in your seat.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Very well-made and exciting. Kirk's/Pine's bromance with Spock/out actor Zachary Quinto is further and nicely developed here, and the film's 3D effects are truly special."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I like this movie a lot, but the part with the tribble was totally stupid."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"..the epic scale of the action and amazing quality of the visuals, plus the sheer fun of hanging with trusted friends, puts this entry light years ahead of most competing blockbusters, even if intellectually it never leaves space dock."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Do we boldly go where no man has gone before? From a plot standpoint, the answer is a resounding no, but that doesn't mean that its is a boring retread of past storylines. It's an energetic, thrilling mash-up of past storylines."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The sequel lacks the consistent creative vision of the 2009 outing. Nevertheless, Star Trek Into Darkness should satisfy the hardcore Trekkers while reaching out to audiences unfamiliar with the [ series'] mythology."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Action set pieces interrupt with sonic booms, like clockwork, whenever the character development lasts more than a few minutes."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,a complex plot that manages to balance character writing with slam-bang action sequences
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"You don't have to be totally immersed in Trekkie lore to follow ""Into Darkness,"" but a bit of basic Trek 101 would at least shed a little guiding light."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It's definitely a fun action movie, but I'm ready for these films to boldly go in their own direction, instead of hanging on to the originals."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A tribute to excess, but in a good way, sort of."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Most of the logic has leached away from this movie, and with it half of the fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Shiny all over: the explosions (MANY), the destruction (MUCH) and the death toll (HIGH) feel like someone demanded this sequel ""take it up a notch."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Abrams works in scenes of friendship, honour, loss and loyalty, but the drama coasts on the emotional legacy of the series rather than creating any of its own heart or warmth."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I was comforted to see a warp drive spacecraft could be kickstarted like a 1912 Buick, and we were treated to not one but two desperate uses of the fabled ""manual override."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"At its best, Star Trek Into Darkness is Cumberbatch; at its worst, it's cumbersome."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A safe sequel which, while certainly engaging and entertaining enough to recommend, fails to live up to the franchise's daring, appointed mission 'to boldly go where no man has gone before.'"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Like the Vulcan IDIC, it is infinite diversity in infinite combinations, allowing for surprise as tropes regroup and characters react in accordance with what we've come to expect from them, but with refreshing twists."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Happily, there's a good deal of fun if you like things crashing violently into each other and out of warp-drive at regular intervals."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Pine and Quinto have grown into their roles and seem much more assured than four years ago. Quinto is especially impressive. This could be the best Star Trek movie of them all.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"While it doesn't quite reach the giddy heights of its 2009 predecessor, this new picture is terrific popcorn entertainment, the sort of bright, brawny blockbuster that used to define the summer movie season."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Action-packed Star Trek sequel has good story, characters."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"For the most part, the film is a carbon copy of the last one, in both its strengths and weaknesses."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The set up for future sequels is not done subtly but with an assurance that this puppy is going to be around for a long while.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The new Star Trek film by wunderkind director JJ Abrams is much, much better than his much-lauded 2009 Trek reboot. It had to be...Abrams has packed together a ripping, morally complex, highly intelligent story with some truly awe-striking visuals."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The best tear-pumpers are the simplest: the passing mention of a starship called the USS Bradbury, or Kirk helplessly extending his arm to a crewman falling past him to his death."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"More business than artful execution. Director J.J. Abrams just isn't a natural born storyteller, all high notes and no rhythm."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It is a fine movie, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. There was something missing that didn't make this film bad but also didn't make the film great."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,For all its chasing and falling and fighting-and the movie supplies a great deal of each-Star Trek Into Darkness is at its best when the Enterprise crew are merely bickering and bantering among themselves: less space opera than soap opera.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Let the summer movie sweepstakes begin! Funny, reverent, suspenseful, heartfelt, chock-full of dazzling effects. Easily one of the best in the durable franchise!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,There's a palpable new comfort level among the performers in their iconic roles for the second time and working from a script that has moved beyond introductions and reacquaintances for audiences.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The conceptual sci-fi of the original series is nowhere to be found, though you might enjoy watching the skinny young actors approximate their counterparts from the 60s; Chris Pine is especially good as Captain Kirk."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The humor in the dialogue, always droll and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, relies mostly on Quinto's ability to give deadpan line readings."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"For Trekkies, Abrams' film is part two of an extended, mostly pleasurable exercise in alternate reality resonance -- it's like film fan fiction, minus the slash-fic component."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,A popcorn sci-fi movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Entertaining, smartly written, and well-paced, Star Trek Into Darkness is actually a better film overall than 2009's Star Trek."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Yet, wherever ""Into Darkness"" goes, it is looking over its shoulder, giving its audience knowing nods and winks, encouraging viewers to recall its past instead of concentrating on its here and now."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"t may have taken me two films, but I'm finally on board with this Star Trek reboot."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,A beautiful film with an ugly third act.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,From the opening thrills to the explosive end you will find yourself immersed by everything Star Trek.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Most of Star Trek Into Darkness will have its audience cheering, the rest feels like a slap across the face."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Techno overkill is a big part of the movie's fun, and nothing overkills quite like IMAX."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,All hail director J.J. Abrams! He hit gold again.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Though purists may disagree, Abrams' two Star Trek features rank atop their predecessors, eclipsing ... all but the best of the classic Star Trek films."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,'Evil Benedict Cumberbatch.' It's almost as much fun to say it as it is to watch it happen on the screen.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Great visuals, but hurt by storytelling cheats in the first and third acts"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"""Darkness"" a Worthy Addition to ""Trek"" Canon"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,J.J. Abrams isn't only resuscitating the franchise. He's improved it.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,[Abrams] might as well have made Fast and Furious 7: In Space No One Can Hear You Drift.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Star Trek Into Darkness goes exactly where I thought it would -- and still feels completely satisfying.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness does a nice job of providing all the excitement and explosive moments one expects from a blockbuster of this sort, but it might try a little too hard to hit the obligatory beats for fans of the franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"""Star Trek Into Darkness"" handily breaks the curse of every other ""Trek"" film being lackluster, with Abrams offering at least as much action, humor, and small character moments as he did the first time around."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Hey, if you're a huge Star Trek fan, you will probably love this film. I get that --- but for those of us who prefer the repartee between William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy --- well, this isn't that!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Call me old-fashioned -- or any other name that comes to mind --- but give me the old TV ""Star Trek"" any time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"While the action is often electric, it's the relationships that matter. That, and a lippy regard for a cultural legacy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The film is, for whatever else it might be, one of the funniest of the Star Trek entries."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I'm sure this movie will upset a few fanboys here and there, but I thought this was a terrific, crowd pleaser of a film. Loaded with action and humor, this is summer blockbuster escapism at it's best. Better than the first!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Abrams and company have followed a Hollywood truism in the comic-book movie field: if you want to have a really good villain, hire a Brit..."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The post-conversion 3D is disappointing, but the newest Star Trek adventure remains exciting summer entertainment with a most appealing ensemble cast."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A simple, character-based story with some well-timed scenes of excitement is what made the first installment great. Star Trek Into Darkness is just good."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Paramount to the success of this series is the perfection of its regular cast, who have made these iconic roles their own."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A good movie but unlike Abrams first effort, it doesn't boldly go where no one has gone before."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Much like Kirk and his crew, Abrams and his team still manage to get the job done despite the criticisms that they've drifted from the Enterprise's original mission."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Star Trek Into Darkness is a step forward from Abrams' initial foray into this universe in the 2009 movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Another bold and exciting voyage for the Starship Enterprise - one that will likely wow most moviegoers (even if it irks a few die-hard Trekkies).
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"an amazing experience, both giddy in its dedication to the beginnings and arrogant in its desire to mess with everything the previous franchise worshiped"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Loaded with wall-to-wall action, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is a blast of summer movie fun. While it's probably geared to a more mainstream audience, if Trekkies go in with an open mind, they'll probably love it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,For two movies in a row now -- and possibly even more in the second than the first -- [Abrams has] caught some of the spark of the first Star Trek without either mimicking or desecrating the original.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The real revelation is Cumberbatch, who steals the show as the film's alluring yet evil antagonist."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Yes, this one is even better: funnier, brawnier and ingeniously constructed for appeal to both devoted fans and reluctant converts."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Overall, it's fun popcorn entertainment, but nowhere as enjoyable and/or brilliant as the 2009 reboot of the franchise. "
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Through Abrams' beautiful use of Giacchino's epic film score, 35mm anamorphic lens flares, and his incredible detail in character, I found myself weeping nerd tears! See it in IMAX!"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The result is a wild piece of entertainment that manages to be about something. Beam yourself up for this one.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"J.J. Abrams's Star Trek Into Darkness, the sequel to his prequel, delivers the goods, even if some of the goods are less than fresh."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Rip-roaring set-pieces aside, the biggest pleasure here is still the yin-yang chemistry between Kirk and Spock, even as the writers sand down the barbed edges of the characters' interactions."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"If anything, Into Darkness shoves a Klingon dagger right between hard-core Trekkers shoulder blades. But those folks were never Abrams' target market, obviously. Everyone else may very well have a warp-speed blast."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Abrams' space isn't the final frontier: The landscape reads more like, ""Haven't we been here before?"" Well, yes, but a whirligig doesn't go anywhere, either, and it's still fun to watch it spin."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek: Into Darkness does not quite reach the heights of the first film, but it does pass muster as a terrific summer popcorn movie."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Abrams proves he can more than back up the smack, so series fans just need to cower as he backhands them upside the head."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is one of the most aggressively self-conscious summer blockbusters ever made."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The weaknesses covered up by the fan-boy thoroughness of the last Enterprise outing are more glaring this time. It's not enough to present caricatures of the original cast
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Abrams boldly goes into Star Trek Into Darkness, and crushes it again. It's more fun and more intense, without giving less to the characters."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The qualitative gap between narrative mechanics and character work is about as stark as it could be, but the latter is so effective, and the cast so tremendously effective in their roles, that Star Trek Into Darkness works well, all things considered."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It leaves fans wondering what's next in the franchise, which will surely make Paramount happy, but doesn't stand on its own like the truly great part twos."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Nearly as exciting and engaging as its predecessor, and just as supremely well crafted."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Action, action and more action defines J.J. Abrams' latest Star Trek. Benedict Cumberbatch makes an excellent bad guy. Did I mention the action?"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I couldn't help feeling let down. Not because J.J. Abrams and his writers have ignored what ""Star Trek"" fans want. It's that they've pandered to it to such a degree that it feels less like fan appreciation and more like base-covering pragmatism."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"While not marking as significant a step to boldly go where few science fiction sequels have gone before, Abrams makes a very entertaining one."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Into Darkness repeatedly and unapologetically sacrifices science-fiction thoughtfulness on the altar of blockbuster ""Wow."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"This story is in the most literal sense, close to home."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,...this is one voyage that Enterprise fans will be happy to take.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A spirited and ripping sci-fi yarn that works every bit as well as that first one -- and, at least on one level, even better."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The day may come when they stumble as their predecessors did. That day is not today.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,This is sufficiently rousing and entertaining that it should please a majority of movie-goers whether they're confessed Trek fans or not.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,By film's end it's clear that Abrams really needed two films to fully complete his reboot
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"This is an exciting entry -- one of the best entries, really -- in the series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Abrams and his team have shown tremendous care for [the franchise] and have discovered exactly what it is that makes the fans love it as much as they do.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Giving all impending summer 2013 tentpoles a reason to be intimidated, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" should safely reintroduce audiences to just how much fun moviegoing can be."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I thought it was really fun, an inventive, surprising rethinking of some of ""Star Trek's"" most hallowed inventions, but I'm not wedded to the source material as gospel. Trekkies will think it's a desecration. So, pick your side"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness offers [a] qualified satisfaction, which, especially after the second half, is akin to the relief of surviving a long beating."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Into Darkness is a sleek, thrilling epic that's also a triumphantly witty popcorn morality play. It's everything you could want in a Star Trek movie."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I'd say it's a good thing I went into Star Trek Into Darkness with lowered expectations, because I ended up liked it way more than I expected to."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Instead of reminding us why we love the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, Into Darkness floods the screen with spectacle and relies on memories of the past to fill in the blanks."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Without missing a beat, Abrams continues with his reimagined Star Trek universe, offering satisfying nods to the past and a fresh surge forward."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"What this movie does with a not-unfamiliar-to-some story is pretty clever, and the incarnation of a classic villain by British cheekbone virtuoso Benedict Cumberbatch is vivid and engaging."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It's a great deal of brash fun, and it should satisfy all those basic Trekkie cravings."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"If the action scenes aren't up to par, and the passion isn't in evidence, then what is there? This movie is fine, and dull."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"For all its reckoning with mass destruction, this franchise's vision of a future Earth remains optimistic. The film mixes the iconically familiar with the futuristic."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness still has the explosive power of high-end entertainment. And it features some crafty allusions to other movies in the genre, but it's as artful as a shotgun blast. It hits the mark, but shreds the entire target."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness banishes, at least for the moment, the lugubrious mood and sepulchral look that too many comic-book movies mistake for sophistication. All hail an action film that isn't ashamed to have fun and to be seen doing it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Like its entertaining predecessor, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" offers much of what the fans expect and not much of what they don't. This character-driven vehicle is a supercharged example of cinematic craftsmanship."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It's hyper-competent and technically slick, yet made with affection, and emotional and textual understanding of the old TV show."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Trek lite. Perhaps in the next film Abrams and company may set their sights on something more ambitious: finding consequential new stories to tell in their rebooted universe.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" -- once you understand it as a generic comic-book-style summer flick faintly inspired by some half-forgotten boomer culture thing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"J.J. Abrams' second Star Trek movie is chock-full of goodies, but by the last quarter the action is so inflated and relentless that it's like an anvil chorus played on your head."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Abrams stays true to the main virtues of the series: The camaraderie of the Enterprise crew, the bond of friendship among Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy, and the way the old series created science-fiction allegories to explore current dilemmas."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Into darkness it should go, where no one can see it"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Maybe it is too late to lament the militarization of Star Trek, but in his pursuit of blockbuster currency, Mr. Abrams has sacrificed a lot of its idiosyncrasy and, worse, the large-spirited humanism that sustained it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"This is the same Enterprise crew we've known for 40-plus years, but they're just different enough to pop a few surprises on you."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"An immensely engaging sci-fi thriller about friendship, leadership, and loss in a tense and war-mongering intergalactic world."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,This latest movie has a formula that's rare for summer blockbusters: smart and engrossing plot + a barrage of big-budget special effects = an overwhelmingly good time.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"You barely get a chance to catch a breath as this saga takes off like a starship and just keeps going, from its Indiana Jones-style opening to its cosmos-rattling finale. And all in 3D, no less."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Even more entertaining than Abrams' first one...the first real blockbuster hit of the summer.

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It's fantastic to watch the Enterprise rev up to light speed, leaving twin trails behind its nacelles, like an intergalactic hotrod burning celestial rubber. But as with the film's predecessor, simple emotion is what grounds the story."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Jettisoning the franchise's optimistic, socially aware sci-fi, not to mention character development or a logical plot, Darkness turns out to be any Vulcan's worst nightmare: Team America: World Police with Tribbles."

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A brilliant, bromantic blockbuster."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Abrams might not have improved on his original. But he leaves Star Trek in shape to warrant a 50th anniversary blockbuster... in 2016!

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,A solid but infrequently spectacular addition to a rejuvenated franchise.

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"As in the first film, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are an inspired pairing as Kirk and Spock, and their squabbling bromance provides Into Darkness's breathlessly-paced adventure with a heart."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The spectacle remains in this sequel but the IQ of the franchise takes a massive nose dive
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"English actor Cumberbatch is strikingly malevolent as the villain here, but he's matched by Quinto (who again almost out-Spocks Spock), Zoë Saldana's Uhura, Simon Pegg's near-OTT Scotty and even Pine, whose Kirk is tougher here than in the first flick."

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,The Force is strong with this one.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Some of the Kirk vs. Spock scenes I felt were a retread of the first film, but it's a minor bone to pick with an otherwise tremendous sci-fi movie."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I'd say it ranks slightly below the 2009 reboot - it's good, not great."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I enjoyed Into Darkness immensely, and I can't wait to see it again... but I'm not sure I could call this a summery popcorny sort of film. It's too grim for that."

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness is bolted together with clinical precision by Abrams, who orchestrates each daredevil chase and skirmish with breathless abandon."

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It is with grand scale, good storytelling & a real spirit of adventure that J.J. Abrams' second film torpedoes onto the screen in 3D, bringing the kind of special effects fantasies are made of."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"As brash, spectacular and energetic as its immediate predecessor, but without novelty on its side"
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"I had begun to wonder if any of these big budget monstrosities could deliver something special; something that didn't feel like a facsimile of previous successes, totally devoid of heart and humanity. Star Trek Into Darkness is... almost that."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness remains great fun for non-fans, but especially the faithful, with nods to some of their favourite tropes ..."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"In some sense, the title is misleading. Into Darkness is a blast, fun, funny, spectacular and exhilarating."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,A perfectly functional sequel that nevertheless falls rather short of 2009?s water-tight reboot.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It goes quickly, it goes loudly and it goes spectacularly. The only problem is that it never seems to live up to the franchise's original mission statement and go boldly"

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The production gives the impression of a massive machine cranked up for two hours of full output; it efficiently delivers what it's built to do, but without style or personality."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A pretty relentless piece of summer entertainment, anchored by what I consider one of the most exciting movie star performances in recent memory."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Open yourself up to the Star Trek universe and enjoy the thrill of the ride.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"It still has that urgency that made the first film so appealing, those big, optimistic messages of right vs wrong in a world at war."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"The Enterprise and all the people on it are gorgeous. It's just that by front-loading so much on the visceral thrills and our affection for these characters, there's just no room for the rather tangled storyline."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"A blaze of thrilling sci-fi adventure, stunning special effects and - most importantly - further subtle development of a series of characters who are familiar and yet fresh at the same time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"This latest Star Trek wavers entertainingly between the silly and the Shakespearean. After a shaky, old-school start, the comedy comes at warp speed."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,That pioneer spirit? It's gone.
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a big film, building on the foundations of its predecessor and holding true to the nature of the franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"People are unlikely to charge out of the cinema with quite the same level of glee as they did in 2009; but this is certainly an astute, exhilarating concoction."

Star Trek,STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,Star Trek Into Darkness will send Trekkers into paroxysms of delight.

Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Star Trek: Beyond is a film worth marvelling at.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"There is still fun to be had here with Pine, Zachary Quinto as Spock and a particularly impressive Karl Urban as Dr McCoy. The weak spot continues to be Simon Pegg who, perhaps aware of his limitations in the role of Scotty, is co-writer."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The pay-off pairing is Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Jaylah, both engineers-the way Scotty instantly recognizes and respects Jaylah's mechanical gift is incredibly refreshing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"... straight forward, thrilling action adventure featuring gorgeous visuals and very little of what made original fans of the Trek series geek out."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,It blandly goes where it's been before.

Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,It breaks the mold created by the first two films in a good way.

Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond is instead happy to rest on the laurels of simple, sublime familiarity."

Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"This is something that has been missing from Star Trek for a while: an arresting picture of a shiny, hopeful future worth dreaming of."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Sure, TREK BEYOND is an entertaining ride... But that... is at the center of why the J.J. Abrams-produced reboot runs afoul of the spirit of what STAR TREK was always about: Tackling complex social issues with inventive and diplomatic workarounds."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,A decent film in the long-standing series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"This third installment in the millennial Star Trek reboot races along without an idea in its head, often recalling the silly, monster-driven final season of the 60s TV show."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Star Trek Beyond is a highly entertaining summer blockbuster for fans and casual moviegoers that pays respect to the franchise legacy.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The movie bounces along, hurtling its heroes over colliding wreckage and into currents of artificial gravity, pausing just long enough for a punchline or a knowing exchange of looks."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"A few logical fallacies aside, this one's really enjoyable."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Though the film glides merrily through its paces, it has no more urgency than a mid-season episode of a Trek TV show."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,This well-paced outer space adventure is a glowing tribute to the iconic television series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Works best as a rousing adventure story that celebrates the power of capable, dedicated people working together."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Siphoning out the fistfights and exploding spaceships from its two-hour running time would leave about 30 minutes of plot, a sign that this story is essentially an overcomplicated TV episode rather than a movie."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Come to 'Star Trek Beyond' for the pow; stay for the emotional wipeout.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Lin and his cast's clear affection for the material helps temper the familiarity. The Enterprise's mission was to explore strange new worlds. This movie's is to give us a smooth ride.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It's not just a blast but, at moments, a thing of beauty, alive to the comic awesomeness of being lost in space."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"When the film is on the move, it really moves."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"If you're a fan, you should offer thanks to the prophets of Bajor, because Star Trek is back on form."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The issue is that Beyond tries to be a ""hip"" Star Trek story. Star Trek can be many things; hip is not one of them."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Doesn't boldly go where other Star Treks have gone, but hey, it's Star Trek so what's not to love? Fun film and the second best of the now three reboots."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Another successful and engaging episode in this long-running sci-fi saga.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond lives up to its title: It goes above and beyond what was expected, and, like its predecessors, turns out to be the best blockbuster of summer 2016."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,The actors work so well together that they reinforce the series' central appeal: This crew is like family.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"This is the sort of reboot I like because it's there for everyone. Star Trek devotees will have their specialised views on its place in the 13-film universe, but average viewers will not feel marooned."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,The movie never delivers on its considerable promise because it's always in such a hurry to get to the next action scene.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It's exactly the kind of fun, steeped in effervescent goodwill that Hollywood should be delivering right now."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,[Director Justin Lin's] sweeping vision emblematizes the galactic scope of the setting and the dramatic stakes of the story.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"That combination of action and humor is enough to make ""Star Trek Beyond"" a cosmic summer blast of fun of which -- despite a couple of illogical moves -- the late Anton Yelchin, our new Chekov, and Leonard Nimoy, would have been proud."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Generic plot, meaningless action, overdone CGI, forgettable villain. The camaraderie of the first of the three in short supply. Only Karl Urban scores."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"In a summer top-heavy with... depressing underachievers, Star Trek Beyond is a breath of fresh air -- not a clever or innovative movie, but one with at least an idea in its head and the dose of optimism we all need right about now."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"If that's what you're looking for -- basically a shoot 'em up set amongst the stars -- then it's fun and fits the bill. But true Star Trek fans will not really be satisfied, as the higher, thought provoking ideas are missing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,It's a surprisingly joyful throwback to everything that makes the Star Trek universe great.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Until a richer villain and more thought-out story come along, we at least have this chapter, which offers fans of the original Trek world some of the things they've most wanted: space to enjoy all their old heroes, and reasons to respect them again."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Star Trek Beyond is a mea culpa to fans who felt the new film series abandoned the franchise's network TV roots.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Hope, unity and growth all lay the groundwork for the thematic emotional pull of the film as our characters strive to be the best they can be."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"All the best parts of a summer movie, all the worst parts of a Star Trek film."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"A return to form for the franchise, thanks to note-perfect performances, thrilling action and a script that strikes exactly the right balance between homage and reboot."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Beyond is, above all else, fun to watch; it's a proper Star Trek experience. And it feels profoundly good to say that."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,It's actually refreshing for a big-screen Star Trek to have a 'regular episode' feel.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The crew has been well cast, and although this may not be their most memorable adventure, it's still a cut above your average action blockbuster."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The balance between wit, irreverence, philosophy, blockbuster tropes and action is deft, but if only the plot had been more convincing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Is Beyond better than the previous two versions? Not at all. Is Beyond a solid action film with the franchise's signature wit and social relevance? Absolutely. Is Beyond terribly predictable? Without a doubt. Will anyone care? Nope!
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The nostalgia may be absent, but so, too, are the two most vital elements of the franchise: character and ideas."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,It's a safe entry into the Star Trek canon. ?But what lies Beyond is going to require a little more depth if the Enterprise is boldly continue.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,A back-to-basics Trek that puts the franchise back on solid ground.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Lin's flashy sense of stylized grit is lost in a sea of sci-fi noise as ""Beyond"" becomes a monotonous blur of space babble and battles."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The relentless overload of CGI, dazzling at first, grows tedious after awhile, and sometimes exhaustingly incoherent."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Stop all the CGI action pieces! We just wanna watch Spock and Bones bicker.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It's an entertaining diversion featuring characters we like to watch, all of which helps distract one from the pic's various issues. "
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,To boldly go where no man has gone before is not for a property so culturally and economically exploitable.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Beyond doesn't have the tactile crash-smash thrill of Vin Diesel gunning a Charger. It's more like that dumb gag in Furious 7 when cars skydive from a plane.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek, in its many permutations and generations, is supposed to be about optimism, inclusiveness and faith in the future. That's something this picture gets right, and it's no small thing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond takes the series to a louder, hollow and more explosive frontier. Yes, it's still fun, but it comes by it in a cheaper, eager to please fashion."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Justin Lin's take on the iconic series is not your father's Star Trek.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Longtime fans will remember that there used to be a rule of thumb about the movies: the ""even ones"" were the good ones. Now it looks like it will be look for the ""odd ones."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Everything you want a post-modern ""Trek"" movie to be: funny, poppy, self-referential -- and with Captain Kirk punching bad guys in rubber masks."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,[It's] a really satisfying adventure that comes closest to recapturing the spirit of the original series - and is perhaps the first film in the rebooted series that truly stands on its own.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"From action to aliens, Star Trek Beyond combines the legacy of the franchise with contemporary visual effects to create a production that should live long and prosper."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"An enjoyable if unexceptional episode in the ongoing series, more place-holder than game-changer, not the culmination of a trilogy but a solid springboard for further adventures."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It trades a nice line in the 'big dumb fun' brand of stupidity, instead of the 'hound Damon Lindelof off Twitter' variety."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,The thirteenth Star Trek movie adventure pleasingly and emphatically returns the latest reboot and its replacement cast to the vibe and spirit of the classic TV series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Beyond, which sees the previous two Trek films' director, J.J. Abrams, handing the reins to Fast and Furious franchise favorite Justin Lin (don't worry, there are still lens flares), has a plucky, engaging panache."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The 13th overall movie in the Star Trek franchise turns out to be good luck for everyone. It's a fresh, satisfying return to the beloved characters of the 1966-1969 TV series and to a rousing sense of teamwork."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The critics' Prime Directive demands that I not reveal any of Beyond's surprise plot twists, but they are often so random that I could probably sneak in one or two without even calling attention to them as spoilers."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,It delivers a satisfying and amusing dollop of sci-fi comfort food.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,something of interest for any generation of Trekkie
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The fact that the result is serviceable, delivering enough value to be worth a fan's time, is about as good as one could reasonably expect."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"A good old-fashioned Star Trek romp through space. Simon Pegg has worked wonders with the script and generously given the best lines to Spock and Bones, whose pairing here is a delight."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"""Star Trek Beyond"" is better than not-bad. By any earthly standard it's good."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Sci-fi fans will surely see beyond any shortcomings and appreciate a film full of visual dazzle, action and suspense."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Justin Lin has taken over the helm from J.J. Abrams, but he's not about to change course, at least as far as reusing old material goes."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond offers a simple, but much-need message of strength in unity and power in diversity."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"In the barren desert of summer 2016 blockbusters, this is a lovely oasis."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"There is plenty in Star Trek Beyond for diehard Trekkers to enjoy, and director Justin Lin guns the action sequences - even if that motocross machine that Kirk is ostensibly riding looks totally fake and video-game-ish."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It's brightly coloured eye-bait, Jim, exactly as we know it."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"After spending two movies getting back on its feet again, ""Star Trek"" has rediscovered its heart."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Granted, with all the galaxies at its disposal, and yet another TV series in dry dock, one might hope for a Star Trek movie with a bit more narrative heft. But in terms of delivering solid entertainment for its devoted base? Mission accomplished."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The pattern for these pictures has been set for decades, and this latest entry in the series breaks little new ground."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The latest in the rebooted franchise, dedicated to the late Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin (appearing as Chekov for the last time here), is like an oversized episode of the original television series, and that happens to be a good thing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It might even feel like you're back in your rec room, circa 1967, drinking Tang and waiting for the Tribbles."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"""Star Trek Beyond"" is not a stale rehash ... But it is another case of an aging franchise running short of good individual films, even when it pursues an alternate timeline."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It may not boldly go where no ""Star Trek"" film has gone before, but it gets there at warp speed, and with a full tank of fresh ideas."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond may not go where no Trek has gone before, but [its] fidelity to the show's original values that will keep fans trekking to the box office."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"""Star Trek Beyond"" works, first and foremost, as a crowd-pleasing science-fiction adventure, but it is equally notable as a thoughtful rumination on embracing one's larger purpose and coming to terms with the temporariness of life."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"This is the third of the rebooted new generation Star Treks, and ultimately leaves you with the feeling that the intrepid crew of the starship Enterprise continue to boldly go, but still haven't quite arrived."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Beyond injects some much-needed fun into the ongoing series that is sure to make hard-core Trekkies and casual fans desperate to boldly go alongside them as they continue to make more.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The actors had their roles down by the end of the first film, and it's a pleasure watching them play the familiar crew with just enough of a twist to fit the new timeline."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"'Star Trek Beyond' is not a grand return to form, nor is it a stellar life-affirming entertainment. But it is a modest step in the right direction."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond is a vast improvement from the sloppy Into Darkness, bringing it on par with the excellent '09 reboot in terms of sheer quality and chemistry."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,What a load of fun.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Feels more like an elaborate TV episode than a cinematic event. But it's a comfortable film...in which the familiar faces don't go anywhere no man has gone before - boldly or otherwise - but they seem to be having a rousing good time anyway.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Stark Trek Beyond emphasizes the inter-personal dynamics of the USS Enterprise, and functions best as an extended team-building exercise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"If it doesn't offer anything particularly groundbreaking, Star Trek Beyond is nonetheless an exciting, well-crafted actioner."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Strives to be a traditional adventure to help realign creative chi, while still allowing Lin to play around with widescreen action, giving the 13th ""Trek"" movie some real velocity."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,A necessary and welcome course correction; a Star Trek back into the light.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,The reason why 'Beyond' works better than the previous two Trek films is because there's an emphasis on exploration and discovery. 'Beyond' feels rooted in the TOS episodes where the crew would find themselves on an alien planet.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Fairly forgettable, but as entertaining summer fare it will more than engage blockbuster-friendly audiences."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Pegg has story and narrative structure down, although where he really wins is how he gives Star Trek back that philosophical side."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Intense action; smart, funny nods to its roots while moving in a new direction; and explicit confrontation of a problem always at the heart of Star Trek "
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"They should have called it ""Star Trek Into Drowsiness."""
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"You could ask for more, but Star Trek Beyond is more than enough to be contented with."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Lin seems most concerned with keeping things moving, and on that score he succeeds."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"While there might not be much going on beneath the surface of Star Trek Beyond, it's certainly fun to go along for the ride, whether or not you'll remember it in two weeks' time."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"In a time... when people are being pitted against one another by virtue of their place of birth or their faith, it's the reminder we need of how the collective can work together for something bigger and better than their own immediate self-interest."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"There's nothing new in Star Trek Beyond, the latest installment in the venerable 13-film series, but its least inspired stretches still manage to play like a crowd-pleasing and exceptionally well-acted Star Trek clip show."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,There's little sense of a larger purpose or of any movement forward for any of these beloved characters.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Lin knows how to shoot his fights from unexpected angles and with enough spatial-temporal variables to keep us jolt-addicts rocking in our seat, happy to be dizzy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,The Justin Lin-directed sequel quickly gets the crew back on track by delivering a very entertaining and often kind-hearted summer movie.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"...has the feel of an obligatory installment, an effort aimed mostly at meeting a summer release date and fulfilling cast contracts."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Though its sense of peril would barely raise a sweat in a kindergarten, the film has surprising vim for the third part in a franchise inspired by a 50-year-old TV show."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond is basically fast and furious in space. It will entertain the majority, but leave Trekkies nostalgic. Alas, Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek is no more."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"When it works, Beyond is great... but predominantly this is so-so Star Trek that feels like a small episode of one of the series, enlarged for the big screen."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"There are bright, busy ""Star Trek"" movies, full of wit and interest, and then there are ""Star Trek"" movies like this one, that are subdued and dark, as if imbued with the monotony of being stuck on a space ship for five long years."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Lin keeps this tense adventure ... from stumbling over its own excess: he knows that any good Star Trek needs wit as well as spectacle.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It's witty, spectacular and expertly paced by action specialist Linn who has managed to recapture the spirit of The Original Series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The most explosive, intense Star Trek yet, and it's so relentless you don't have time to worry about what's missing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"To reinvigorate the franchise's sense of purpose, new recruit Justin Lin takes things back to their roots and core values, while also injects some of the dynamic action that he has honed on multiple Fast and Furious sequels."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"What works (marginally) in this instantly forgettable entry: a few diverting character moments...fan-serving fairy dust...action, action, action."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Pandering? Yes. But pandering with polish.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Whatever is done to recalibrate the sequel, here's hoping a better balance of humour, meditative contemplation and thrilling, big-screen spills is struck. Still, there are worse crews to be shipwrecked with for two hours."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,It's just like watching a big budget version of The Original Series.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond is much more than a mere refresh. Thanks to Lin's steady directorial hand and knack for visualizing improbable set-pieces, the new film is bold, breathless and propulsive, a distillation of the action movie to its purest elements."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Justin Lin's take on J.J. Abrams' reboot of the franchise, while taking it back to basics, fails to do little else but give you the faint promise of excitement, but never fully delivering."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"I hope, I truly do, that Star Trek Beyond marks a return to a real golden age of big-screen cinema, with Star Wars and now Star Trek now both seemingly back on track and delivering exactly what we hope for."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It would be optimistic to expect the franchise to venture into new conceptual territory at this point. As in the Abrams films, a vague pacifist message is undercut by the frenetic, bloodlessly violent action obligatory in modern Hollywood blockbusters."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"If anything, a little more Enterprise was needed in the creative stakes to make this a more memorable experience. As things stand, it merely does what you'd expect."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Not every wheel needs reinventing, and one of the abiding pleasures of ""Star Trek,"" in its old and newer iterations, lies in its balance of stubborn consistency and canny inventiveness."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"This third film of the rebooted series is all slick spectacle, created for 3D cinema."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"While Star Trek Beyond absolutely delivers as a pure, pulse-raising spectacle, it is also none too shabby as a rollicking adventure yarn."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"This is clearly not the greatest film ever made by any means, but it is eminently palatable summer fare. If you are planning a trip to the cinema this weekend, it is the film to see."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,It's freewheeling enough to entertain a casual moviegoer - and faithful enough to satisfy a Comic-Con nerd.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Lin, a mastermind of car chases, brings his imaginative sense of spectacle to space, and the result is something truly sensational, and befitting a summer blockbuster."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It's big and loud, but also has a heart, which is all we could have asked for."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond is a snappy, diverting affair that nevertheless leaves a lingering feeling, like Kirk, that something's missing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"If you wrote a list of what you wanted from a Star Trek film, from action and humor to strong characters (both male and female) and a solid storyline, this delivers and it deserves your dollars."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Following the ponderous and leaden Star Trek Into Darkness, Fast and Furious director Justin Lin puts real zip back into the space-going franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond, like most of the rebooted properties flying around our movie theaters, delights in nostalgically resurrecting iconic characters and tweaking them anew."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Though the action-packed trailers might suggest he simply launched that manic vibe into space, Lin and scriptwriters Simon Pegg and Doug Jung made a clever plot move that gives Beyond the most breathing room for its characters in years."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Lin's movie works best when approached as a relaxed, somewhat playful two-hour expansion of one of the old '60s episodes."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,A grand scale sci-fi adventure with eye-popping visuals
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"...a bold, entertaining spectacle..."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"What's most notable about the new film is how closely it hews to Gene Roddenberry's original TV series, at least in spirit."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Beyond goes from being a fun action movie to a great Star Trek movie, and one that's the closest of the reboots to capturing the spirit of the original series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The kind of movie the bloated second one should have been: a one-off romp - a super-sized version of an old episode, just with more hot-dogging motorcycle stunts and stuff going boom."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"A hugely enjoyable romp. Alien hordes, Enterprise annihilation, ass-kicking females, emotional goodbyes ... this one has it all."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The galactic adventure might be an uneven one, but the combination of gravitas, a little mirth and old-school Trek themes makes Beyond a decently entertaining trip to the final frontier."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Star Trek Beyond may not be the perfect Star Trek film, but it is unashamedly, entertainingly and enthusiastically a true one -- and that's more than enough for this Starfleet lifer."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"If you're even remotely interested in a new Star Trek film, this feels like everything you could have asked for. Here's hoping the great adventure continues for another 50 years from here."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Star Trek Beyond should appeal both to older audiences who remember the glory day days of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy and to younger ones looking for a placebo while they wait for the next Star Wars.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"I can think of no better way to celebrate Star Trek's 50th anniversary than with this film, which embraces everything that's great about the series."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"A film that preaches the notion of togetherness as a means of triumphing in the face of adversity, is a rather important one to indulge in right about now."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"An enjoyably old-fashioned entry in the new series. Short on back story, long on action, loads of fun."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It makes very few promises it can't keep, but also goes halfway out on every limb it can find, risking next to nothing, sights permalocked on par."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"When Beyond soars, it hits a sweet spot of perfectly balanced stakes, momentum, character development, callbacks, music, and action, blasting at full power in particular in one memorable space-battle set piece that punches in just the right moments."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Ultimately, Beyond is a movie about characters - and character. But that's half the battle. The other half of the battle is... battle. And Lin, who has such a strong track record with vehicular mayhem, doesn't bring his ""A"" game."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It's not hyperbole in the least bit to say that Star Trek Beyond perfectly celebrates 50 years of the franchise, while taking these stories into a bold new future where anything is possible for Captain Kirk and the fearless crew of the USS Enterprise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Justin Lin has given fans an impressive sequel.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"While Lin's success with big battles and explosions are hardly a surprise given his background in the Fast & Furious franchise, that in no way undercuts how jaw-dropping and thrilling Star Trek Beyond's biggest set pieces are."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Michael Bay has won. Every movie has now become a music video, even a legendary science fiction franchise."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The drama never swamps the film's humour, and it combines a glossy Hollywood sense of wonder with that classic Star Trek optimism. In the uncertain world we live in, it couldn't feel more timely."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"While he may have seemed like a counterintuitive choice to take over a Star Trek movie, Lin is absolutely in his element whenever the film becomes about bodies and vehicles moving swiftly through space - which is often."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The third instalment of the re-booted Star Trek franchise gets safely through its voyage, offering a strong returning cast and a familiar, if slightly tweaked mix of effects-heavy space action, cheeky humour and philosophical musing"
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"""Star Trek Beyond"" is a somewhat diverting place holder, but one hopes that the next ""Star Trek"" movie will have what it takes to boldly go where no ""Star Trek"" movie has gone before."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Powered by a spirited sense of adventure and a nice teamwork dynamic, it's fun, but not essential, summer viewing."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"A return to fun, and a return to form for the new version of the old Trek."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"Finally recaptures the spirit of the original, and it's beyond entertaining."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"While this is not your father's ""Star Trek,"" it still feels like a fan's - and just the kind of warm, inclusive, feel-good entertainment this summer needs."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,An entertaining adventure.
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"The script injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"It starts and ends exceptionally well, but it gets bogged down in the middle."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"This episode cuts right to the core of the series's original appeal, giving the terrific cast a chance to play against one another in a straightforward story. It's not exactly bold, but ""Beyond"" does satisfy."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,"While ""Star Trek Beyond"" lacks a center, it compensates with an endless parade of distractions. When the movie moves along at a breezy clip, it's partly because it feels so purposeless."
Star Trek,STAR TREK BEYOND,Not since the original crew stepped down have we felt such a vivid sense of adventure and comradeship.
